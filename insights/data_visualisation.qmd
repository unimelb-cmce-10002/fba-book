# Data Visualisation for Business Intelligence

::: {.callout-tip}
## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

* Explain how different visualization techniques reveal patterns in retail beer data that would be difficult to see in tables or raw numbers.
* Implement appropriate visualizations using ggplot2 to analyze relationships between beer prices, sales volumes, and brand categories.
* Compare price elasticity patterns between domestic and imported beer brands using log-log demand curve visualizations.
* Assess which visualization approaches most effectively communicate specific insights about beer pricing and demand.
* Design a visual analysis that could inform practical pricing decisions for a retail category manager.

## Today's Business Challenge
### Understanding Price Sensitivity in Beer Sales {.unnumbered}

* Australian retailers make thousands of pricing decisions
* 1% improvement in pricing → 11% profit increase
* Beer: $16.8 billion Australian market
* Our question today: How do price changes affect sales across different beer brands?

### Today's Data: Retail Scanner Data from Dominick's Finer Foods {.unnumbered}

* Weekly sales for four major beer brands for a Chicago based retailer
* Price, quantity, store location, and promotional information
* Similar to what Woolworths and Coles analysts work with daily
* Real-world retail data to discover real-world patterns{.unnumbered}

### Today's Method: Data Visualization {.unnumbered}

> "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see." — John Tukey

* Visual processing is 60,000× faster than text - spot patterns and outliers instantly
* Bridges the gap between data scientists and business decision-makers
* Reveals hidden relationships that drive consumer behavior and pricing effectiveness
* Transforms complex numerical relationships into actionable insights for category managers

### Where we're headed {.unnumbered}

Just a few lines of R code transform numbers into business intelligence

From this: (table)

to this: Insert final plots 


## The Game Plan: What we're aiming for

Recall our workflow:

1. Plan and sketch an endpoint.
2. Simulate and consider that simulated data.
3. Acquire and prepare the actual data.
4. Explore and understand the actual data.
5. Share what was done and what was found.

Sketch the plan & "Simulated Graphs"

## Loading and Understand the Data

### R pacakages for today {.unnumbered}

Add libraries

### Loading the Data in R {.unnumbered}

Read csv file

#### The Beer Sales Dataframe {.unnumbered}

Explore data frame, define any necessary terms

## Visualizing the Data

Detour: Viz principles + ggplot "building"

### Visualizing Price Distributions {.unnumbered}

Exercise. Box plot for Qty

Here's my solution

:::

### Visualizing Quantity Sold {.unnumbered}   

Exercise: Distribution of Prices

### Detour: Adding Style to our plots

Exercise: Style up the "other plot"

### Visualizing Demand Curves {.unnumbered}

Exercise. Do this by brand rather than by import status

## Putting it all together: Sharing Our Results 

Final plot. 


Exercise. Write 2-3 sentence summary of what can be seen in the plot 

Exercise. Do the same but for plots by Brand rather than import status. Write a summary.

## Conclusion 

We've highlighted one key principle per plot:

* With price boxplot: "Choose visualizations appropriate to your question"
* With density plots: "Color enhances categorical comparison"
* With demand curves: "Transformations (like log scales) can reveal patterns"
* With faceting: "Small multiples help compare across groups"
