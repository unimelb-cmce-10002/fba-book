# Descriptive Analytics

**Learning Goals** 

- Understand what descriptive analytics means in a business context.
- Learn how clustering (K-means) and association modeling (Naive Bayes) can support business decisions.
- Apply both techniques to a real-world marketing case study.
- Practice interpreting and communicating results for business decisions.
- Connect analysis to core marketing concepts like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and RFM frameworks.
- Understand the limitations of descriptive analytics.

## Introduction to Descriptive Analytics

**Definition:**
Descriptive analytics helps businesses summarize and understand what has happened in the past. It provides a foundation for further analysis by transforming raw data into meaningful information.

**In business, descriptive analytics answers questions like:**
- Who are my best customers?
- What products are selling well?
- When do we experience peaks in demand?

**Key Features:**
- Focuses on patterns and trends in historical data
- Organizes and summarizes information
- Supports business storytelling with data

> **Reminder:** Descriptive analytics helps us "describe" what is happening — we are not yet making predictions or running experiments.

## Case Study: Customer Segmentation for an Online Retailer

Imagine you work for an online retailer. Management wants to:
- Better understand different types of customers
- Identify which customers are most likely to respond to marketing offers

**Available Data:** (based on Chapman & Feit, 2019)
- **Recency**: How recently a customer has made a purchase
- **Frequency**: How often the customer purchases
- **Monetary Value**: How much money the customer spends
- **Response**: Whether the customer responded to a previous marketing offer (yes/no)

These three features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) together form what is called an **RFM Framework** in marketing.

## What is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) estimates how much revenue a customer will bring over their relationship with a company. Customers with high RFM scores are often the most valuable.
:::

**RFM Framework:**
- **Recency**: Customers who purchased recently are more likely to buy again.
- **Frequency**: Customers who purchase often are more engaged.
- **Monetary**: Customers who spend more are usually more valuable.

Understanding RFM helps businesses estimate a customer's future value (CLV).

This gives us an opportunity to **describe customer behavior**, **cluster customers**, and **summarize patterns of campaign success**!

## K-means Clustering: Grouping Similar Customers

**Goal:**
Find natural "clusters" or groups of customers who behave similarly, without knowing their group labels in advance.

**How K-means Works:**
1. Choose the number of clusters (K).
2. Randomly assign customers to clusters.
3. Calculate the "center" (mean) of each cluster.
4. Reassign customers to the nearest center.
5. Repeat until cluster assignments stop changing.

**Hands-on Walkthrough:**
- Start by plotting recency and monetary value.
- **Question:** What do you notice about where the points are concentrated?
- Apply K-means with different values of K (e.g., K=2, K=3).
- **Question:** Does one cluster seem bigger or smaller than the others?
- Interpret what each cluster might represent (e.g., "Frequent Big Spenders", "Infrequent Bargain Shoppers").

**Simple Analogy:**
Imagine you're sorting socks by color without labels. You group similar colors together by looking at them, not by reading tags.

**Business Use:**
- Design different marketing strategies for each cluster.
- Identify groups based on RFM behavior linked to potential CLV.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Mini Visual:** Before K-means: random points → After K-means: color-coded clusters.

> **Reminder:** Clustering is descriptive. We are finding patterns, not making predictions.


## Naive Bayes: Describing Patterns of Response Behavior

**Goal:**
Summarize how customer behavior (recency, frequency, monetary value) is associated with marketing campaign response.

**How Naive Bayes Works:**
1. Use past data where responses are known.
2. Apply Bayes' Theorem to estimate likelihood of response.
3. Assume features are independent given the response.

**Hands-on Walkthrough:**
- Add the "Response" variable.
- **Question:** Which features (recency, frequency, or monetary) seem to matter most for responses?
- Calculate the likelihood of response based on features.
- **Question:** Are customers who buy more frequently more likely to respond?
- Summarize the key patterns you observe.

**Simple Analogy:**
Imagine you're guessing whether a customer will respond to an ad based on their past shopping habits — you use simple "rules of thumb" based on each feature separately.

**Business Use:**
- Describe which types of customers tend to respond.
- Guide marketing strategy based on RFM-linked behavior patterns.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Mini Visual:** Features → Calculate probabilities → Highest likelihood of response.
:::

> **Key Point:** Naive Bayes here is used to describe associations in customer behavior, helping us summarize response patterns.


## Limitations of Descriptive Analytics

While descriptive analytics is powerful for organizing and summarizing information, it has important **limitations** to keep in mind:

- **Describing is not explaining:** Patterns we observe (e.g., frequent buyers respond more) do not prove one thing causes another.
- **Hidden patterns:** Sometimes, averages can hide differences between groups. (This is known as **Simpson's paradox**.)
- **Over-simplification:** Summaries and clusters simplify complex behaviors but may miss important details.

### Simulation: Simpson's Paradox in Marketing Campaigns

Imagine you run two marketing campaigns targeting customers based on **purchase frequency**:

| Customer Group  | Campaign A Response Rate | Campaign B Response Rate | Number of Customers |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Frequent Buyers | 80%                        | 70%                        | 50                   |
| Infrequent Buyers | 30%                       | 20%                        | 200                  |

- Among **frequent buyers**, Campaign A performs better.
- Among **infrequent buyers**, Campaign A also performs better.

Suppose Campaign B heavily targeted frequent buyers:

| Customer Group  | Campaign A Customers | Campaign B Customers |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Frequent Buyers | 50                     | 150                   |
| Infrequent Buyers | 200                   | 50                    |

In that case, Campaign B might appear better **overall**, even if it was worse within every segment!

> **Lesson:** Descriptive summaries (like overall response rates) can be misleading if we don't account for differences between customer groups. Proper segmentation based on RFM features is critical to correct interpretation.
