# What is Business Analytics?

## Introduction: Business Decisions in a Changing World

- Businesses have always faced important decisions: hiring, investing, advertising.
- Traditionally, decisions were based on experience or instinct (the "HIPPO" — Highest Paid Person's Opinion).
- Today, businesses increasingly use data to inform and improve decisions.
- Yet, the essence of decision-making — **telling a compelling story about what to do next** — remains as old as humanity itself.
- > **Quote:** "Let the data tell its story." — Gregory Crawford

## How Business Decision-Making Has Evolved

- **Stage 1: Gut Instinct (HIPPO)** — Experience, intuition dominate.
- **Stage 2: Simple Data Support** — Basic reports, forecasts support decisions.
- **Stage 3: Advanced Analytics** — Predictive modeling (e.g., machine learning).
- **Stage 4: Experimentation and Causal Learning** — A/B tests, causal analysis guide strategy.
- Optional callout:
  - > **Quote:** "At Netflix, every decision is backed by an experiment."
  - > **Quote:** "Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day." — Jeff Bezos

## What is Business Analytics?

- **Definition:** Using data and models to solve business problems and improve decision-making.
- Involves:
  - Defining problems
  - Collecting and cleaning data
  - Analyzing data appropriately
  - Communicating insights through persuasive, relatable stories
  - Acting to create value
- > **Quote:** "Data are widely available; what is scarce is the ability to extract wisdom from them." — Hal Varian

## The Three Types of Business Analytics

- **Descriptive Analytics:** What happened? (e.g., sales reports)
- **Predictive Analytics:** What might happen? (e.g., forecasting next quarter)
- **Causal (Prescriptive) Analytics:** What will happen if we act? (e.g., pricing experiments)
- **Key Insight:** Different problems (prediction vs causal) require different tools.

## The Power and Limits of Analytics

- Good decisions depend on good data.
  - > **Principle:** Garbage in, garbage out.
- Analytics cannot eliminate uncertainty or judgment:
  - Models simplify reality.
  - Trade-offs (e.g., short-term vs long-term, efficiency vs innovation) must be managed.
- Analysts must think critically, tell coherent stories from data, and question results.

## Ethics in Business Analytics

- Data use raises ethical responsibilities:
  - Avoid bias.
  - Protect privacy.
  - Promote fairness.
- Ethical analytics supports sustainable and responsible business.

## Examples of Business Analytics in Action

| Business Area | Descriptive | Predictive | Causal |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Sales | How much did we sell last quarter? | What will sales be next quarter? | What if we change pricing? |
| Marketing | Who clicked our ads? | Who will buy next? | What if we target a different segment? |
| Hiring | How many applicants applied? | Who will accept our offer? | What if we change recruitment practices? |
| Finance | What was our cash flow last quarter? | Will we meet next quarter’s revenue goals? | What happens if we change credit policies? |
| Accounting | What were our expenses last month? | What costs will rise next year? | What happens if we automate reporting? |
| Supply Chain | How many units were delivered on time? | Where will delays occur next month? | What if we switch suppliers? |

## Becoming a Business Analyst: The Interpreter Role

- Business analysts are "interpreters" between data and decision-makers.
- Humans are natural storytellers — since ancient times, stories have been how we made sense of the world.
- Today’s analysts continue this tradition: using data to tell clear, truthful, and compelling stories to guide action.
- Key skills:
  - Business understanding
  - Data analysis
  - Communication and storytelling
- > **Quote:** "MBAs who have good business intuition but also speak the language of statisticians are rock stars." — Susan Athey
- Teamwork is essential — collaboration across data engineers, analysts, business owners.
- The goal: help businesses understand their world and act wisely.
