In this course, you’ll build the essential skills needed to analyze and interpret data for better business decision-making. 
Whether you’re new to coding or looking to strengthen your analytical thinking, we'll guide you through the fundamentals of working with data in R — structuring, transforming, and visualizing information effectively.

Business analytics is more than just working with numbers — it’s about understanding what happened, anticipating what will happen next, and uncovering why things happen. Through hands-on practice, you’ll apply these approaches to real-world business problems, learning how to extract meaningful insights that drive action.

Throughout the course, you’ll develop a practical toolkit: just as a business strategist assesses market trends and customer behavior, you’ll learn how to clean, explore, and communicate data-driven insights. We’ll introduce best practices in data wrangling, visualization, analysing and interpreting data and reproducible analysis, helping you work efficiently and transparently.
Most importantly, you’ll learn how to tell compelling stories with data, turning raw information into insights that influence business decision-making.
