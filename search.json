    "text": "Welcome\nIn this course, you’ll develop the essential skills to analyze and interpret data for better business decision-making. Whether you’re new to coding or looking to strengthen your analytical thinking, we’ll guide you through the fundamentals of working with data in R — structuring, transforming, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting information effectively.\nBusiness analytics spans three critical dimensions: understanding what happened in the past, anticipating what will happen next, and uncovering why things happen through causal analysis. Through hands-on case studies, you’ll apply these approaches to real-world business problems, extracting meaningful insights that drive action. The power of data lies in the stories it tells. From ancient oral traditions to modern visualizations, effectively communicated insights create impact. You’ll learn to transform raw data into compelling narratives that enhance clarity and directly influence business decisions.\nYour approach will mirror that of a scientist: observing carefully, experimenting methodically, and making evidence-based predictions about firm and consumer behavior. This systematic framework provides a practical toolkit for addressing complex business challenges. With this analytical power comes significant responsibility. We’ll explore ethical dimensions of working with sensitive information, recognizing and mitigating bias, balancing analytical insight with individual rights, and ensuring transparent communication of findings.\nFor knowledge to create value, it must be communicated clearly and transparently. You’ll develop workflows that ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability — critical skills for building trust in your analysis.\nData is everywhere, but enduring insights are rare. This course will help you transform numbers into knowledge that informs business and society—ethically, responsibly, and effectively.",

    "section": "2.2 The 8 Skills of a Business Scientist",
    "text": "2.2 The 8 Skills of a Business Scientist\n\nBriefly introduce why skills—not just tools—define success in business analytics.\nMention that some skills are universal across projects, while others depend on the analyst’s role and the company’s approach.\n\n\n2.2.1 The Skills\nMore broadly, here’s 8 skills one needs to succeed:\n1. Understand the Business World (Institutional Detail) Think of businesses like ecosystems—each one has its own rules, customers, and competitors. A good data scientist needs to understand the “world” they’re working in. For example, analyzing data for a coffee shop is very different from doing it for a tech company.\nExample: Before analyzing sales data for Starbucks, you’d need to know about things like seasonal drinks, customer loyalty programs, and how locations affect sales.\n2. Finding the Right Data (Data Discovery) Data is like treasure—it’s valuable, but you have to know where to find it. This could mean collecting sales numbers, website clicks, or social media mentions. Learning how to gather and clean this information is the first step in solving real business problems.\nExample: Imagine you want to help a clothing brand figure out which products are popular. You’d need to collect sales data, reviews, and maybe even social media trends to understand what customers love.\n3. Understanding How People and Businesses Work (Business Theory) Why do people buy certain products? Why do companies offer discounts? A data scientist needs to understand basic ideas about what drives business decisions and customer behavior.\nExample: If a phone company offers discounts during holidays, you’d want to see if that really boosts sales—or if people would have bought the phones anyway.\n4. Picking the Right Tool (Analytical Model) Different problems need different tools. Just like you wouldn’t use a spoon to cut steak, you need the right model to answer different business questions. Some problems are simple and need basic math; others might need advanced computer algorithms.\nExample: Predicting tomorrow’s weather needs a different tool than figuring out which Netflix shows you’ll like next!\n\nKnowing What Could Go Wrong** (Analytical Theory) Data isn’t always perfect. Sometimes there are mistakes, missing information, or patterns that don’t mean what they seem to. A good data scientist knows how to spot and fix these problems.\n\nExample: If an online store has a glitch that doesn’t record weekend sales, it could look like no one shops on Saturdays—but that wouldn’t be true!\n6. Coding and Tech Skills (Computational Skills)\nThis is where programming comes in. Data scientists use code (like Python or R) to organize data, run calculations, and create visual charts. It’s like having a toolbox full of digital gadgets to solve problems faster and smarter.\nExample: Think of learning Python like learning a recipe—once you know the steps, you can tweak things to cook up new results!\n7. Telling the Story with Data (Presentation & Communication) Even the best analysis won’t help if no one understands it. Data scientists must explain their findings clearly—usually with visuals, graphs, and simple explanations.\nExample: Instead of saying, “Sales grew by 15% in Q3,” you could show a simple graph that highlights how sales shot up after a new product launch.\n8. Asking the Right Questions (Creativity & Judgment) The hardest part of data science isn’t always finding answers—it’s asking the right questions. This skill is about being curious and thinking creatively about what problems are worth solving.\nExample: Instead of just asking, “How many shoes did we sell?” you might ask, “What time of day do we sell the most shoes—and why?”\n\n\n2.2.2 Applying and Combining the Skills\nEssential vs. Role-Dependent Skills\n\nSome skills are fundamental to all projects, while others depend on the analyst’s role and the company’s needs.\nUniversal Skills (Always Needed):\n\nUnderstanding the Business World\nFinding the Right Data\nTelling the Story with Data\nCreativity & Judgment\n\nRole/Project Specific Skills (Vary by Context):\n\nBusiness Theory → Possible Example: Strategic roles, consulting\nAnalytical Tools → Possible Example: Predictive modeling\nSpotting Errors → Possible Example: Compliance-heavy industries (finance, healthcare)\nCoding & Tech Skills → Possible Example: Data engineering, Data Scientist\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1 Mixing the Skills for Different Business Needs\nThe Analyst’s Role Determines the Skill Set.\nEvery project requires a different combination of skills.\nFor example\n\nA Marketing Analyst relies more on storytelling, consumer behavior, and data discovery.\nA Data Engineer prioritizes coding, automation, and infrastructure over business theory.\nA Financial Analyst needs strong data accuracy skills and an understanding of economic principles.\n\neven then, the same project can be approached differently by different roles and skillsets.\nExample Case (Different Roles, Same Goal, Different Approaches):\nSuppose a company wants to reduce customer churn.\n\nA Data Scientist would use predictive models, while a Marketing Analyst would analyze customer feedback.\nBoth would rely on data storytelling to explain their insights.\n\nChoosing the Right Skill Mix for a Project\nEvery project requires a different combination of skills.\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Building a Versatile Skill Set\nHow to Identify Which Skills to Develop\n\nSelf-assessment: What skills do you already use? Where do you struggle?\nCareer aspirations: What roles interest you? What skills are essential for those?\n\nDeveloping Skills Over Time\n\nMastering core skills before specializing\nContinuous learning through projects, courses, and collaboration\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 The Eight Skills and this Course\nEmphasizing:\n\nAdaptability is Key. The best business scientists balance universal and role-specific skills.\nLearning to adapt to different business problems is more important than mastering any single tool.\nAdopting a workflow that allows us to mix and re-mix as the project / case requires",

Management wants to: - Better understand different types of customers - Identify which customers are most likely to respond to marketing offers\nAvailable Data: (based on Chapman & Feit, 2019) - Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase - Frequency: How often the customer purchases - Monetary Value: How much money the customer spends - Response: Whether the customer responded to a previous marketing offer (yes/no)\nThese three features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) together form what is called an RFM Framework in marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?\n\n\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV) estimates how much revenue a customer will bring over their relationship with a company. Customers with high RFM scores are often the most valuable.\n\n\nRFM Framework: - Recency: Customers who purchased recently are more likely to buy again. - Frequency: Customers who purchase often are more engaged. - Monetary: Customers who spend more are usually more valuable.\nUnderstanding RFM helps businesses estimate a customer’s future value (CLV).\nThis gives us an opportunity to describe customer behavior, cluster customers, and summarize patterns of campaign success!",

Choose the number of clusters (K). 2. Randomly assign customers to clusters. 3. Calculate the “center” (mean) of each cluster. 4. Reassign customers to the nearest center. 5. Repeat until cluster assignments stop changing.\nHands-on Walkthrough: - Start by plotting recency and monetary value. - Question: What do you notice about where the points are concentrated? - Apply K-means with different values of K (e.g., K=2, K=3). - Question: Does one cluster seem bigger or smaller than the others? - Interpret what each cluster might represent (e.g., “Frequent Big Spenders”, “Infrequent Bargain Shoppers”).\nSimple Analogy: Imagine you’re sorting socks by color without labels. You group similar colors together by looking at them, not by reading tags.\nBusiness Use: - Design different marketing strategies for each cluster. - Identify groups based on RFM behavior linked to potential CLV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMini Visual: Before K-means: random points → After K-means: color-coded clusters.\n\n\n\nReminder: Clustering is descriptive.

    "text": "10.5 Limitations of Descriptive Analytics\nWhile descriptive analytics is powerful for organizing and summarizing information, it has important limitations to keep in mind:\n\nDescribing is not explaining: Patterns we observe (e.g., frequent buyers respond more) do not prove one thing causes another.\nHidden patterns: Sometimes, averages can hide differences between groups. (This is known as Simpson’s paradox.)\nOver-simplification: Summaries and clusters simplify complex behaviors but may miss important details.\n\n\n10.5.1 Simulation: Simpson’s Paradox in Marketing Campaigns\nImagine you run two marketing campaigns targeting customers based on purchase frequency:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Group\nCampaign A Response Rate\nCampaign B Response Rate\nNumber of Customers\n\n\n\n\nFrequent Buyers\n80%\n70%\n50\n\n\nInfrequent Buyers\n30%\n20%\n200\n\n\n\n\nAmong frequent buyers, Campaign A performs better.\nAmong infrequent buyers, Campaign A also performs better.\n\nSuppose Campaign B heavily targeted frequent buyers:\n\n\n\nCustomer Group\nCampaign A Customers\nCampaign B Customers\n\n\n\n\nFrequent Buyers\n50\n150\n\n\nInfrequent Buyers\n200\n50\n\n\n\nIn that case, Campaign B might appear better overall, even if it was worse within every segment!\n\nLesson: Descriptive summaries (like overall response rates) can be misleading if we don’t account for differences between customer groups.

    "text": "The Topic: Understanding Melbourne’s Housing Market\nMelbourne’s real estate market is one of the most dynamic in Australia. Property prices are influenced by several factors, including location, dwelling type, and proximity to the Central Business District (CBD). Buyers, sellers, and policymakers constantly analyze housing trends to make informed decisions. Understanding these trends is crucial in a $2 trillion+ housing market, where even small fluctuations in pricing expectations can have significant financial impacts.\nA key question we will explore is: How do property prices vary by region, dwelling type, and location? By analyzing real estate data, we can identify patterns that help explain the drivers of Melbourne’s housing prices and their implications for different stakeholders in the market.\n\n\nThe Data: The Melbourne Housing Market Dataset\nWe will use a dataset containing real estate sales data from Melbourne. The dataset provides insights into housing trends and includes key variables that influence property prices.\nThe dataset captures the property location within broader metropolitan regions (regionname), allowing us to compare trends across different areas. It also includes the type of dwelling, classified as House (h), Townhouse (t), or Apartment (u), enabling us to assess price differences based on housing type. The sale price (price) provides a measure of market value, while the distance to the CBD (distance) helps analyze the impact of proximity to the city center on property prices.\nSimilar datasets are widely used by real estate analysts, banks, and property investors to assess housing trends, predict future movements, and guide investment decisions. Through this tutorial, we’ll work with real-world data to uncover patterns and develop a deeper understanding of Melbourne’s property market. Let’s dive in!\n\n\nWhere we’re headed\nJust a few lines of R code transform numbers to data visualizations.\nFrom this:\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 6\n   type      address          postcode   price distance regionname    \n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         \n 1 House     85 Turner St         3067 1480000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 2 House     25 Bloomburg St      3067 1035000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 3 House     5 Charles St         3067 1465000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 4 House     40 Federation La     3067  850000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 5 House     55a Park St          3067 1600000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 6 House     129 Charles St       3067  941000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 7 House     124 Yarra St         3067 1876000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 8 House     98 Charles St        3067 1636000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 9 House     217 Langridge St     3067 1000000      2.5 Northern Metro\n10 Townhouse 18a Mollison St      3067  745000      2.5 Northern Metro\n\n\nto this (REMARK Still need to complete the pretty-ing of plots)",

    "text": "Prepare these Exercises before Class\nPrepare these exercises before coming to class. Plan to spend 90 minutes on these exercises.\n\nExercise 1: Plotting Number of Listings by Region\nBy the end of this exercise, your plot should look similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a). If you were a real estate investor or city planner, why would knowing the number of listings by region be valuable? What decisions could be influenced by this visualization?\n(b). Use the starter code below to create a first version of the bar plot. Replace YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME with the appropriate variable name from the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Bar Plot?\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar plot is a graphical representation of categorical data, where each category is represented by a bar whose height reflects its frequency or proportion. It is commonly used to compare counts across different groups, making it easy to identify the most and least common categories in a dataset. In business and research, bar plots help visualize trends, distributions, and key differences in data at a glance.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_bar()\n\n(c). Extend the plot above by adding labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and title. Use the labs() function to add these labels. The code below also rotates the axis labels by 25 degrees to improve readability.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, hjust = 1),\n    )\n\n(d). Change the color of the bars using the fill argument in geom_bar(). You can use any color you like, see (here)[https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-color.html] for a list of colors you can choose from.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_bar(fill = \"YOUR_COLOR\") +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, hjust = 1),\n    )\n\n(e). What patterns do you notice in the number of listings? Are certain regions overrepresented or underrepresented? How might this affect housing supply and pricing?\n(f). What could be improved in the visualization? Consider aspects like color, ordering of bars, labels, or additional annotations.\n\n\nExercise 2: Visualizing the distribution of Prices by Dwelling Type\nBy the end of this exercise, your plot should look similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a). Why is a histogram useful for understanding price distributions? What insights can we gain from plotting price distributions separately for each dwelling type?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Histogram?\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram is a visualization that represents the distribution of numerical data by dividing values into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. Unlike a bar plot, which displays categorical data, a histogram is used for continuous variables like price, age, or distance.\nHistograms help identify patterns in data, such as skewness, outliers, and central tendencies, making them a crucial tool for understanding how values are distributed in a dataset.\n\n\n\n(b). Use the starter code below to create a basic histogram of house prices. Replace YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME with the correct variable.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50)\n\n(c). Extend the plot above by adding labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and title using the labs() function.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50) +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\")\n\n(d). Modify the x-axis so that prices are displayed in dollar format by adding scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar). We have rotated the axis labels to make the numbers easier to read.\n\nhousing %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = price)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50) +\n    YOUR_CODE_HERE +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1),\n    )\n\n(e). Add fill = type inside aes() to color the histogram by dwelling type and then create subplots by dwelling type.\n\nhousing %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = price, YOUR_CODE_HERE)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50) +\n    YOUR_CODE_HERE +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1),\n    ) +\n    YOUR_CODE_HERE\n\n(f). What does the histogram tell you about price differences between dwelling types?\n(g). What additional improvements or customizations could enhance this visualization? How might these changes improve clarity, interpretability, or storytelling in the data?\n\n\nExercise 3: The Price - Distance Relationship\nBy the end of this exercise, your plot should look similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a). Why might we expect a relationship between price and distance to the CBD?\n(b). Use the starter code below to build a scatter plot of price vs. distance, replacing YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME with the correct column names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Scatter Plot?\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables by plotting individual data points. Each dot represents one observation, helping identify patterns, clusters, and trends. In this case, it allows us to explore how house prices change with distance.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n(c). Since we have a large number of data points, many overlap, making it difficult to distinguish individual observations. Modify the geom_point() function to reduce over-plotting by adjusting the alpha value. Experiment with different values (e.g., 0.1, 0.05, 0.01) and describe how each affects the visualization.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = YOUR_NUMBER)\n\n(d). We can better understand the relationship by adding a statistical transformation to the plot. Complete the geom_smooth() function call to overlay a straight line over the data. The se = FALSE argument removes the confidence interval around the line.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = YOUR_NUMBER) +\n    geom_smooth(method = YOUR_METHOD, formula = YOUR_FORMULA, se = FALSE)\n\n(e). Finally, add labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and title using the labs() function. You can also customize the color of the points and the line using the color argument.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = YOUR_NUMBER, color = \"YOUR_COLOR\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = YOUR_METHOD, formula = YOUR_FORMULA, color = \"YOUR_COLOR\", se = FALSE)\n    scale_y_continuous(YOUR_CODE) +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\")\n\n(f). What does the scatter plot reveal about the relationship between house prices and distance to the CBD? How does the line help interpret this relationship?",

What steps do you need to take to make these improvements?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Note\n\n\n\nUse this exercise to guide students to the following changes:\n\nCentered title\nDecide to focus on one dwelling type\nColor points to match the House type chosen\nColor blind sensitive palette\nNon-linear model fit\n\n\n\n(c). Implement the changes suggested in the R code below.\n\nhousing %&gt;%\n    filter(type == \"House\") %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = price)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.05, , color = palette_okabe_ito()[2]) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,2), se = FALSE, color = palette_okabe_ito()[6], linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n    labs(x = \"Distance to CBD (km)\", y = \"Price\", title = \"House Price vs. Distance\") +\n    theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  # Center title\n    ) \n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nprice_dist &lt;- \n    housing %&gt;%\n    filter(type == \"House\") %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = price)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.05, , color = palette_okabe_ito()[2]) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,2), se = FALSE, color = palette_okabe_ito()[6], linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n    labs(x = \"Distance to CBD\", y = \"Price\", title = \"House Price vs. Distance\") +\n    scale_color_okabe_ito() +\n    theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  # Center title\n    )  \n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Putting the plots together\n(a). Use the code below to combine the plots for the three exercises above. Replace PLOT_ONE, PLOT_TWO, and PLOT_THREE with the plots you created in Exercises 5, 6, and 7.\n\nPLOT_ONE /    \n    (PLOT_TWO | PLOT_THREE) + \n    plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") & \n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n(b). Save this combined plot as a PDF file using the ggsave() function. You can specify the file name and dimensions using the filename and width and height arguments.\n\nggsave(\"YOUR_FILE_NAME\", width = 12, height = 8)\n\n\n\nExercise 8: Synthesizing the Findings\nIf you were presenting these results in a business meeting, how would you explain the key takeaways? Structure your summary to include:\n\nWhat you analyzed (data, variables)\nWhat you found (key insights from the visualizations)\nWhat decisions could be made based on this information?",
