    "text": "Welcome\nIn this course, you’ll develop the essential skills to analyze and interpret data for better business decision-making. Whether you’re new to coding or looking to strengthen your analytical thinking, we’ll guide you through the fundamentals of working with data in R — structuring, transforming, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting information effectively.\nBusiness analytics spans three critical dimensions: understanding what happened in the past, anticipating what will happen next, and uncovering why things happen through causal analysis. Through hands-on case studies, you’ll apply these approaches to real-world business problems, extracting meaningful insights that drive action. The power of data lies in the stories it tells. From ancient oral traditions to modern visualizations, effectively communicated insights create impact. You’ll learn to transform raw data into compelling narratives that enhance clarity and directly influence business decisions.\nYour approach will mirror that of a scientist: observing carefully, experimenting methodically, and making evidence-based predictions about firm and consumer behavior. This systematic framework provides a practical toolkit for addressing complex business challenges. With this analytical power comes significant responsibility. We’ll explore ethical dimensions of working with sensitive information, recognizing and mitigating bias, balancing analytical insight with individual rights, and ensuring transparent communication of findings.\nFor knowledge to create value, it must be communicated clearly and transparently. You’ll develop workflows that ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability — critical skills for building trust in your analysis.\nData is everywhere, but enduring insights are rare. This course will help you transform numbers into knowledge that informs business and society—ethically, responsibly, and effectively.",

    "text": "1.1 What is Business Analytics?\nBusinesses have always had to make important decisions: Who should we hire? Where should we invest? How much should we spend on advertising? In the past, these decisions were often made based on experience, intuition, or the authority of senior leadership—a dynamic sometimes known as the “HIPPO” effect: Highest Paid Person’s Opinion.\nThat’s no longer enough. Today’s businesses operate in faster, more complex environments. Fortunately, they also have access to something that previous generations did not: data. From customer transactions to social media posts, microsecond stock price information to supply chain records, nearly every part of a business now generates data. A single online purchase creates dozens of data points: what the customer viewed, how long they hesitated, which payment method they chose, even how they arrived at the site. The challenge isn’t collecting it—it’s knowing what to do with it.\nThis is where business analytics comes in.\nBusiness analytics is the use of data and analytical tools to support better decision-making. It combines statistical thinking, technological capability, and business insight. But it’s not just about building models or generating dashboards. At its core, it’s about helping organizations answer the fundamental question that drives all business strategy: What should we do next?\nThat story is ultimately what business analytics is trying to uncover. Analysts help businesses listen to what the data is saying—about customer needs, regulatory risks, investor sentiment, competitive dynamics, or operational bottlenecks—and translate that into actions.\nBut the essence of decision-making remains what it has always been: reasoning through uncertainty, weighing trade-offs, and telling a compelling story about what to do. The difference today is that we can do it better—with data as our guide, structure as our method, and analytical tools that help us move beyond educated guesswork toward informed action.",

    "section": "1.2 How Business Decision-Making Has Evolved",
    "text": "1.2 How Business Decision-Making Has Evolved\nBusiness decision-making has gone through a quiet revolution. While the core challenge—deciding what to do—hasn’t changed, the tools, habits, and expectations surrounding decision-making have shifted dramatically. Business analytics sits at the center of this transformation.\nWe can think of the evolution in four broad stages:\nStage 1: Gut Instinct (The HIPPO Era)\nFor most of the 20th century, decisions were dominated by experience, instinct, and authority. The most senior person in the room often had the final say—regardless of what the data might suggest. This is the “HIPPO” model we mentioned earlier: Highest Paid Person’s Opinion. While experience remains valuable, this approach often lacks transparency and makes it difficult to learn from both successes and failures.\nStage 2: Simple Data Support\nWith the rise of digital systems, businesses began generating and storing data—and using it to create basic reports and forecasts. Dashboards and spreadsheets became common tools for tracking performance. But in this stage, data was mainly descriptive: it helped explain what had happened, not what to do next. Think monthly sales reports or annual budget reviews.\nStage 3: Advanced Analytics\nAs computing power increased, so did analytical ambition. Businesses began using predictive models and machine learning to forecast future outcomes and identify hidden patterns. This allowed for more proactive decisions—anticipating which customers might leave, deciding when to issue stock to raise capital, or optimizing prices dynamically. Yet even the most sophisticated model is only as useful as the decision it ultimately supports.\nStage 4: Experimentation and Causal Learning\nThe frontier today is not just prediction—it’s learning what actually works. Companies now use A/B testing, field experiments, and causal inference to evaluate strategies and understand the true impact of different choices. This lets firms go beyond correlation and ask the crucial question: What happens if we actually do X instead of Y?\n\n“Nearly every decision we make about our product and business is guided by member behavior observed in test” (i.e. an experiment). — Netflix Tech Blog\n\n\n“Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.” — Jeff Bezos\n\nThis shift toward experimentation represents more than just a technical advancement—it’s a cultural transformation. It reflects a mindset that values curiosity, iteration, and evidence over hierarchy or habit. Modern business analytics is as much about learning and adapting as it is about measuring and predicting.",

    "text": "1.3 What is Business Analytics?\nWe’ve spent quite a bit of time talking about business analytics without actually defining it. Time to fix that.\nBusiness Analytics is the practice of using data and models to solve business problems and improve decision-making.\nIt’s not just about collecting numbers—it’s about using them wisely. In today’s data-rich environment, the real challenge is knowing how to extract insight, frame decisions, and take action in a way that creates value.\n\n“Data are widely available; what is scarce is the ability to extract wisdom from them.” — Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google\n\nThat’s where business analytics comes in. It combines technical skills with business understanding to move from raw data to real-world impact. A business analyst doesn’t just answer what happened—they help organizations understand why, predict what might happen next, and evaluate what to do about it.\nThe process usually involves five key steps:\n\nDefining the Problem — Every good analysis begins with a sharp question. What decision needs to be made? What are the options? What does success look like?\nCollecting and Cleaning Data — Data is rarely ready to use out of the box. Analysts spend significant time gathering relevant data sources and ensuring they’re accurate, complete, and reliable.\nAnalyzing Data Appropriately — With the right tools—from simple summaries to predictive models—analysts identify patterns, test hypotheses, and quantify trade-offs.\nCommunicating Insights — Even the best analysis fails if no one understands it. Analysts must tell persuasive, relatable stories with data—stories that clarify the decision at hand and guide action.\nActing to Create Value — Ultimately, analytics only matters if it leads to better decisions. The goal is not analysis for its own sake, but to generate insights that drive strategy, improve operations, control costs, better serve customers, or deliver stronger returns to shareholders.\n\nBusiness analytics is more than a technical field—it’s a way of thinking. It reflects a broader evolution in business: away from gut instinct alone, and toward evidence-based decision-making. But even as the tools evolve—from dashboards to machine learning to experimentation—the fundamental goal remains the same: to make smarter, more confident choices in an uncertain world.",

    "section": "1.4 The Three Types of Business Analytics",
    "text": "1.4 The Three Types of Business Analytics\nBusiness analytics isn’t one-size-fits-all. Different business problems require different types of insight—and therefore, different analytical tools. A helpful way to understand the field is to distinguish between three broad types of business analytics:\n\n1.4.1 Descriptive Analytics: What happened?\nDescriptive analytics focuses on summarizing and reporting what has already occurred in a business. It answers questions like:\n\nWhat were our total sales last quarter?\nWhich products had the highest return rates?\nWhat were the top 10 ASX-listed companies by shareholder return last year?\n\nTools used here include summary statistics, tables, visualizations, and dashboards. These methods don’t make predictions or test strategies—they organize past data in a way that helps managers understand performance, spot trends, or identify anomalies.\nThink of this as the rearview mirror of analytics. It helps you see where you’ve been.\n\n\n1.4.2 Predictive Analytics: What might happen next?\nPredictive analytics goes a step further: it uses past data to forecast future outcomes. This includes questions like:\n\nHow many customers are likely to churn next month?\nHow are annual depreciation expenses likely to change over the next three years?\nWill the RBA cut interest rates next month, and if so by how many basis points?\n\nMethods here often involve statistical models and machine learning techniques that identify patterns and extrapolate them forward. These models don’t guarantee what will happen, but they give decision-makers a probabilistic view of likely outcomes.\nImportantly, predictive models do not answer causal questions. A forecast that sales will increase next quarter doesn’t tell you why—or what would happen if you changed your pricing or launched a new campaign.\nThink of this as the weather forecast of analytics: useful for planning, but not a substitute for experimentation or causal understanding.\n\n\n1.4.3 Causal (Prescriptive) Analytics: What will happen if we act?\nThis is where things get more strategic—and more difficult.\nCausal analytics (sometimes called prescriptive analytics) tries to answer counterfactual questions: What would happen if we did X instead of Y?\nExamples include:\n\nWhat impact will a 10% price increase have on demand?\nHow will merging with another firm affect our share price?\nWould switching to a new supplier improve delivery times?\n\nThese questions can’t be answered by simply observing correlations or running a predictive model. They require methods designed to isolate cause and effect—such as randomized experiments (A/B testing), instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, or other econometric techniques.\nThis is the decision engine of analytics: it helps businesses not just anticipate the future, but change it deliberately.\n\n\n1.4.4 Key Insight: Different Problems, Different Tools\nEach type of analytics serves a different purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nCore Question\nTypical Tools\nBusiness Use\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive\nWhat happened?\nSummaries, visualizations\nReporting and monitoring\n\n\nPredictive\nWhat might happen?\nForecasting, classification\nAnticipating future trends\n\n\nCausal (Prescriptive)\nWhat will happen if we act?\nExperiments, causal inference\nStrategy and decision-making\n\n\n\nChoosing the wrong tool for the question can lead to misleading conclusions. For example, a model that predicts which companies are likely to identify and correct mistakes in their previously published financial statements is not the same as understanding why those mistakes occurred—or what internal controls or governance changes might have prevented them.\nTo be a great business analyst, it’s not enough to know how to use the tools. You need to know which tool matches which question.\n\n\n10 min\n\n\nMatching Analytics Types to Business Questions\nNow that you understand the three types of business analytics, let’s practice identifying which type of analysis different business questions require.\nFor each business area below, we’ve provided examples of questions that fall into our three categories: Descriptive (What happened?), Predictive (What might happen?), and Causal (What will happen if we act?).\nSome examples are filled in to get you started. Your job is to complete the missing entries by thinking about what questions a business analyst in each area might ask.\n\n\nComplete the Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Area\nDescriptive\nPredictive\nCausal\n\n\n\n\nSales\nHow much did we sell last quarter?\n[Your turn: What might happen in the future?]\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\nMarketing\n[Your turn: What happened in the past?]\nWho will buy next?\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\nHiring\n[Your turn: What happened in the past?]\n[Your turn: What might happen in the future?]\nWhat if we change recruitment practices?\n\n\nFinance\n[Your turn: What happened in the past?]\nWill we meet next quarter’s revenue goals?\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\nSupply Chain\nHow many units were delivered on time?\n[Your turn: What might happen in the future?]\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 min\n\n\nClassify These Questions\nFor each question below, identify whether it requires Descriptive, Predictive, or Causal analytics:\n\n“Which marketing channels generated the most leads last month?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“How will our share price change if we replace our CEO with our current COO?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Which customers are most likely to upgrade to our premium service?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Which of our product lines account for the largest share of corporate overhead expenses?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Would offering free shipping increase our conversion rate?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Will analysts issue a buy/hold/sell recommendation for our stock next week?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking Like an Analyst\n\n\n\nRemember: the same business problem can often be approached from multiple analytical angles. The key is being intentional about which type of analysis will best serve the decision you need to make.",

    "text": "1.5 The Power and Limits of Analytics\nBusiness analytics is a powerful tool—but it is not a crystal ball. At its best, analytics sharpens our thinking, clarifies options, and supports better decisions. But it also has limits that every analyst must understand.\n\n1.5.1 Good decisions depend on good data\nIt’s a simple principle, but an essential one: garbage in, garbage out. Even the most advanced model cannot save an analysis built on poor-quality data, vague problem definitions, or biased assumptions. Clean, relevant, well-structured data is a prerequisite—not a guarantee—for good insights.\n\nPrinciple: Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nAnalytics doesn’t make decisions for us. It supports decision-making. The quality of that support depends entirely on the inputs we provide and the care with which we interpret the results.\nThis is why, later in the course, we devote specific chapters to how data is collected and how it is stored and managed—because those choices shape everything that follows in the analytical process.\n\n\n1.5.2 Analytics doesn’t eliminate uncertainty—or judgment\nAll models are simplifications. They help us focus on what matters, but they also leave things out. A forecast can offer probabilities, but never certainties. A causal estimate can quantify impact, but only under specific assumptions. The world is more complex than any spreadsheet or statistical model can fully capture.\nThis means that even with data:\n\nUncertainty remains. Analysts must often make decisions under incomplete information or ambiguous results.\nTrade-offs persist. No model can resolve tensions between short-term gains and long-term investments, or between efficiency and innovation. These are managerial choices, not statistical ones.\nJudgment is essential. Good analysts don’t just run models—they think critically, question results, and tell coherent stories that connect the data to the broader context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: When Forecasting Falls Short\n\n\n\nWoolworths, Australia’s largest supermarket chain, learned this lesson during the ACCC’s 2024-25 supermarket inquiry. Despite having access to massive amounts of checkout data and sophisticated forecasting systems, Woolworths admitted to significant shortcomings in the accuracy of volume forecasts provided to fresh fruit and vegetable suppliers.\nAs CEO Amanda Bardwell acknowledged during ACCC hearings, the company had access to detailed checkout data that should have given them “a firm understanding of likely future demand.” Yet former Managing Director Natalie Davis admitted that an internal review found Woolworths had “failed to provide volume forecasts to suppliers that were as accurate as possible.”\nThe problem wasn’t the technology—it was how they used their data. Davis explained that Woolworths had failed to apply new analytical capabilities as they became available, essentially letting their forecasting methods lag behind their data collection abilities.\nKey lessons:\n\nGarbage in, garbage out: Having lots of data doesn’t automatically lead to good predictions\nTools must match the problem: Fresh produce forecasting requires different approaches than predicting demand for shelf-stable goods\nImplementation matters: Even good analytical capabilities are useless if they’re not properly applied\n\nSource: ACCC Supermarket Inquiry Final Report, March 2025\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 The analyst’s role\nBeing a good analyst means more than knowing the right techniques. It means understanding the business problem, evaluating the quality of the data, and making thoughtful decisions about how to present and interpret results. It’s about being honest when uncertainty is high, and being clear about what the data can and cannot tell us.\nIn short, analytics gives us leverage—but it doesn’t replace leadership. The best decisions come when rigorous analysis meets sound judgment.",

    "text": "1.6 Ethics in Business Analytics\nBusiness analytics is not just a technical activity—it is also a human one. Every decision about what data to collect, how to analyze it, and how to act on it involves ethical considerations.\n\n1.6.1 Data use raises ethical responsibilities\nAs businesses gain more powerful tools to collect and interpret data, they also take on greater responsibility. Three core ethical concerns should guide any data-driven initiative:\n\nAvoid bias.\nAlgorithms and models can reflect—and even amplify—existing biases in the data. For example, a hiring model trained on past decisions may replicate patterns of discrimination unless actively corrected. Ethical analytics involves detecting, understanding, and mitigating such bias.\nProtect privacy.\nWith more data comes more risk. Businesses must handle customer, employee, and user data with care. That means complying with legal requirements (like the GDPR or Australia’s Privacy Act), but also going beyond compliance to ask: Are we using this data in ways that our stakeholders would consider reasonable and respectful?\nPromote fairness.\nDecisions driven by analytics—such as who gets a loan, a promotion, or a targeted offer—can have real consequences. Ethical analytics means being transparent about how decisions are made and striving to ensure that outcomes are just and inclusive.\n\n\nEthical analytics isn’t just about what you can do with data—it’s about what you should do.\n\nThese issues will return in later chapters—especially when we discuss data collection, machine learning, and A/B testing. In each of those contexts, ethical decision-making is not an optional add-on, but a core part of responsible business practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Algorithmic Management and Worker Autonomy\n\n\n\nIn Southeast Asia, ride-hailing platforms like Grab have implemented algorithmic management systems to coordinate labor, match drivers with passengers, and set dynamic pricing. While these systems enhance efficiency, they have also raised concerns about transparency and fairness.\nDrivers often report a lack of clarity on how decisions are made regarding ride assignments and fare calculations, leading to feelings of disempowerment and uncertainty about their earnings. A study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace highlighted that such algorithmic management can disrupt traditional labor relations, making work more individualized and reducing opportunities for collective bargaining.\nThe opaque nature of these systems can exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly for workers in marginalized communities who may lack institutional support. This case underscores the importance of embedding ethical considerations into the design and implementation of analytics systems, ensuring that they promote fairness and transparency for all stakeholders.\nSource: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\n\n\n\n\n1.6.2 Ethics is not optional\nFirms that ignore these responsibilities may face backlash, regulatory penalties, or long-term reputational damage. But beyond risk avoidance, ethical analytics also presents a positive opportunity: to build trust, foster loyalty, and support a more responsible form of business.\nEthical thinking doesn’t happen at the end of an analysis. It must be embedded at every stage—from how we frame questions to how we communicate results. Throughout this course, we will return to this theme as we encounter specific ethical trade-offs in modeling, measurement, and experimentation.\nDone well, business analytics can help firms grow in ways that are not only efficient, but sustainable and fair. It’s up to analysts to ensure that data is used wisely—and responsibly.",

    "text": "1.7 Becoming a Business Analyst: The Interpreter Role\nBy now, we’ve seen that analytics is not just about algorithms and datasets—it’s about decisions. And good decisions need more than numbers. They need interpretation, judgment, and communication. This is where the business analyst comes in.\nBusiness analysts sit at the intersection of data and decision-making. They are not just technicians or model-builders—they are interpreters. Their job is to make data meaningful to the people who need to act on it.\n\n“MBAs who have good business intuition but also speak the language of statisticians are rock stars.” — Susan Athey, Professor of Economics at Stanford\n\nWhile this quote mentions MBAs, it’s not just about the degree. It’s about the blend of skills—business understanding, analytical fluency, and communication—that define a high-impact analyst. And that skillset isn’t reserved for postgrads. A well-trained undergraduate business analyst with this toolkit can add enormous value from day one. That’s exactly the kind of foundation this course is designed to build.\n\n1.7.1 Analysts are modern storytellers\nHumans are natural storytellers. For thousands of years, stories have helped us make sense of complexity—turning scattered events into patterns, and patterns into meaning.\nToday’s business analysts continue this tradition. But instead of myth or anecdote, they use data. The tools may be newer, but the mission is timeless: to tell clear, truthful, and compelling stories that help others see what is happening—and decide what to do next.\nThat story might be about why sales are falling, how investor sentiment is improving, or what might happen if the firm raises prices or changes strategy. But in every case, the analyst’s role is the same: to build a bridge between the data and the decision.\n\n\n1.7.2 Core skills of the business analyst\nTo succeed in this role, analysts need a blend of skills:\n\nBusiness understanding\nYou must understand the context: What is the decision? What matters to stakeholders? What constraints shape the options?\nData analysis\nYou need to clean, explore, and model data using the right tools. This includes both descriptive and predictive methods—and increasingly, causal tools to support strategy.\nCommunication and storytelling\nYou must craft narratives that are not only statistically sound, but also understandable, relevant, and actionable.\n\nThese skills don’t develop overnight. They grow through practice—through working on real problems, engaging with real data, and reflecting on how analysis shapes action. In the next chapter we will devote more time to to thinking about the skill set of a modern business analyst.\n\n\n1.7.3 Collaboration is essential\nBusiness analysts don’t work alone. They collaborate with data engineers, who build the infrastructure and pipelines that make analysis possible; with business stakeholders, who define the problems and act on the results; and with other analysts, who bring complementary expertise and perspectives.\nThe analyst is the glue—the person who keeps the analytical process connected to business goals, ethical standards, and practical decisions.",

    "text": "2.1 Becoming a Business Scientist: A Scientific Mindset Within a Business\nMany students begin a business analytics course expecting to learn tools—how to write some code, build some charts, maybe even fit a model or two. And those are important outcomes. But learning the foundations of business analytics means more than just acquiring technical capabilities. It’s about becoming someone who can use data to tackle messy, ambiguous, and important business problems. That’s a different kind of challenge. It requires not just tools, but judgement. Not just answers, but knowing how to formulate better questions and how to choose the right tools to answer them.\nThis means being able to think conceptually about a problem before diving into data or code. That includes understanding the context, identifying what matters, and knowing how different kinds of questions—descriptive, predictive, or causal—can shape the analysis. It means treating analysis not just as a task, but as a form of problem-solving. This is the mindset of a business scientist: someone who combines data, domain knowledge, and structured reasoning to help businesses make better decisions. This is the identity we’ll use throughout the rest of the book. It’s an opinionated choice, but a deliberate one. We believe “business scientist” captures the blend of analytical skill, conceptual thinking, and real-world impact that defines the kind of analyst we’re shaping you to become. It reflects not just what you do, but how you think—and the value you bring to the organisations you can aspire to work with in the future.\nThis chapter introduces the foundational skills that support that kind of thinking and working. These skills aren’t tied to any one analytics tool, task or business discipline. Instead, they shape how you approach problems, how you engage with data, and how you turn analysis into insight and action. Some of them are technical—like transforming and modelling data. Others are strategic—like understanding the business context or framing a problem in the right way. Still others are communicative—like helping a team of non-technical experts see the story behind the numbers. All of these skills are part of doing good business analytics.",

    "text": "Thinking Like a Business Scientist\n\n\n\nScience is about systematically learning from the world. Scientists don’t just collect data for the sake of it—they begin with questions, develop hypotheses, and design ways to test them. They use evidence to update their beliefs and remain open to the possibility that they might be wrong. Thinking like a scientist means embracing uncertainty, asking sharp questions, and letting the data guide you—rather than simply confirming what you already believe.\nBusiness scientists do the same thing, but in a commercial setting. The tools might look different, and the decisions might need to move faster, but the mindset is the same: stay curious, stay structured, and stay open to what the data is telling you.\nIn business contexts, the questions are often practical—and the stakes are real. You might find yourself investigating:\n\nWhy a product isn’t selling as expected\n\nWhether a loyalty program actually increased retention\n\nHow to segment your customer base more effectively\n\nIn each case, you’re not just reporting numbers. You’re solving a puzzle. You’re forming hypotheses and testing them against available data. You’re navigating messy constraints, incomplete information, and real-world pressure. And you’re building a case that helps someone else—your manager, your client, your team—make a better decision.\nThat’s what it means to think like a business scientist: to combine data and discipline with creativity and judgment, all in service of making sense of the world and creating value from that understanding.",

    "text": "2.3 The 8 Skills of a Business Scientist\nAs we’ve discussed so far, doing business analytics isn’t just about knowing which buttons to press. It’s about how you think—and how you apply that thinking to solve real problems. This emphasis on thinking clearly with data is what sets great business scientists apart.\nIn many workplaces, the focus of those working in business analytics roles often drifts toward tools—what software someone can use, how many models they’ve memorised. But tools are only part of the picture. The best business scientists succeed because of their skillset: the habits of mind, ways of working, and communicative strengths that help them adapt to new problems, collaborate with others, and turn analysis into action. The tools everyone wants to talk about tend to come and go — often too fast for you to reach true proficiency before newer ones take over. Skills, by contrast, stick with you. In what follows, we’ll outline what we believe are the eight essential skills that form the foundation of thinking and working like a business scientist.\nHere are 8 essential skills that make up the foundation of great business analytics:\n\n1. Institutional Detail: Understanding the Business World\nBusinesses don’t operate in a vacuum. Each one exists within a broader ecosystem—shaped by its customers, competitors, suppliers, regulations, the wider industry it operates within and traditions. Great business scientists take the time to understand how their organization works from the inside out. Just like a biologist wouldn’t study an animal without first understanding its habitat, a business scientist doesn’t analyze data without grasping the environment the business operates in. Context isn’t background noise—it’s the terrain in which every decision plays out.\nThis means learning about pricing structures, seasonality, logistics, marketing strategies, regulatory constraints, and competitive dynamics. It means understanding the industry’s rhythms: when do customers typically buy? What external factors drive demand? How does the sales process actually work? Without this context, it’s easy to misinterpret what the data is telling you.\nWe think of learning institutional details as becoming fluent in your company’s language. Every business has its own vocabulary, its own calendar of important events, and its own unwritten rules about how things get done. The more you understand these local dynamics, the better you’ll be at spotting meaningful patterns in the data—and avoiding misleading ones.\nWhile this step can feel dry or peripheral at first, it’s anything but. The deeper you go, the more you’ll find that institutional knowledge doesn’t slow analysis down—it sharpens it. It’s what lets you ask smarter questions, rule out bad explanations, and bring a level of insight that purely technical analysts often miss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Thinking with Context at Starbucks\n\n\n\nBefore diving into Starbucks sales data, a business scientist would first step back and learn how the business actually works. That means understanding:\n\nSeasonal patterns, like when the Pumpkin Spice Latte appears—and how limited-time drinks create predictable spikes in demand\n\nLoyalty mechanics, such as how stars are earned and redeemed, and how that influences purchasing behaviour\n\nStore types, since an airport kiosk has very different dynamics than a suburban drive-thru or university campus location\n\nOperational rhythms, like the intensity of the morning rush, how new drinks are rolled out, or how promotions vary across regions\n\nAll of these shape what success looks like—and what patterns in the data might actually mean.\nWhat could go wrong?\nSuppose you notice a sharp drop in cold brew sales during one week of the quarter. Without context, it’s tempting to infer a shift in customer preferences or the failure of a promotion. But a closer look might reveal something entirely different: a temporary supply chain issue that led to the coffee beans used to make cold brew being unavailable in many stores, or a change in the loyalty program that nudged customers toward redeeming rewards for other products. The data didn’t lie—but interpreting it without understanding the business can lead to the wrong story.\n\n\n\n\n2. Data Discovery: Finding the Right Data\nData discovery is the art of figuring out what information exists—and what’s actually useful. Real-world data is messy and scattered. It lives in spreadsheets, dashboards, PDFs, databases, websites, cloud tools, and even emails. Analysts must be part detective, knowing where to look and who to ask. This involves both technical knowledge, understanding different data formats and storage systems, and social intelligence, knowing which colleagues or third-party data providers have access to what information. But finding the data is only the beginning.\nOnce you’ve tracked it down, you need to map the data landscape: What gets measured? What doesn’t—and why? Who owns which datasets? How frequently is information updated? Just as importantly, you need to assess quality and completeness. Is this data reliable? Are there systematic gaps? Does it actually capture what we care about?\nSometimes, the data you want doesn’t exist at all. In those cases, the your job is to get creative: to find proxies, build new measures, find ways to actively collect the data you need, or rethink the question in a way that makes progress possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Estimating Profit Margins When You Don’t Have Cost Data\n\n\n\nImagine you’re working with sales data from a multinational retailer. The dataset includes product-level revenue, discounting, and returns—but there’s no reliable cost data. You’ve been asked to estimate profit margins across product categories.\nAt first, it seems impossible. But a business scientist doesn’t stop there.\nYou start by mapping what is available: supplier codes, shipping methods, inventory turnover, and some high-level financial statements. Then you talk to colleagues in finance and procurement. Eventually, you piece together a working solution:\n\nYou estimate average unit costs using inventory and COGS figures from quarterly reports.\n\nYou use product weight and supplier codes to model shipping costs.\n\nYou apply assumptions based on margin benchmarks in similar categories.\n\nIs it perfect? No. But it’s documented, grounded, and far better than guessing—or giving up. That’s what good data discovery looks like in practice: not just finding data, but building a defensible understanding of what the data can and cannot tell you.\n\n\n\n\n3. Business Theory: Understand People and Firms\nBehind every data point is a decision. Whether it’s made by a customer, an employee, or an executive, that decision reflects goals, trade-offs, habits, and constraints. If we want to interpret data meaningfully, we need to understand what motivates the people and organisations behind it.\nThat’s where business theory comes in. Theory gives you mental models—ways of thinking—that help you make sense of patterns. You’re not just memorizing textbook definitions of “demand” or “utility.” You’re using concepts like pricing strategy, consumer psychology, supply and demand, and organizational incentives to interpret what you’re seeing in the data.\nWhy might sales spike on certain days? What drives customer loyalty? How do competitors respond to a new product launch? These aren’t just descriptive questions we answer with data —they’re behavioural ones. Theory helps you move from what happened, to why it happened, to what might happen next. In that sense, theory helps you uncover the mechanism—or more informally, the “why”—behind the patterns the data reveal.\nGood business scientists borrow the tools of economists and psychologists among others. They think in incentives, trade-offs, and feedback loops. They understand that behaviour is often predictable—and that understanding those patterns is key to turning data into insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Why Are the Employees Quitting?\n\n\n\nImagine you’re analyzing employee turnover at a large firm. One team has unusually high resignation rates, and leadership wants answers. You start by examining basic patterns—tenure, role, compensation, manager—but nothing obvious jumps out.\nA surface-level analysis might stop there. But a great business scientist brings theory to the table.\nYou recall models of motivation and incentives: Is the bonus structure rewarding the right behaviours? Are promotion paths clear? You consider organizational dynamics: Has there been a change in leadership or reporting lines? Are people leaving for competitors with a more flexible culture?\nYou dig deeper and discover that while pay is competitive, the team’s recent restructuring removed autonomy from senior staff—shifting decision-making to HQ. That’s not in the spreadsheet, but it explains the exits.\nTheory didn’t just help you describe what was happening—it helped you understand why it was happening, and what might happen next if the structure doesn’t change.\n\n\n\n\n4. Analytical Modelling: Choose the Right Tool\nDifferent business problems require different methods. Sometimes a simple average is all you need. Other times, the problem calls for predictive algorithms, statistical models, or machine learning techniques. Great business scientists know how to match the complexity of the tool to the complexity of the task.\nThat means more than just knowing how to run a model—it means understanding the assumptions behind different approaches. When is a correlation meaningful? When do you need a more rigorous method to support a causal claim? How do you trade off accuracy against interpretability? The goal isn’t to reach for the fanciest method — it’s to choose the one that fits the question, the data, and the decision context.\nAnd just as importantly, good analysts know when not to model. Sometimes the clearest and most compelling answer comes from a simple table or visualisation. Sometimes the question isn’t answerable—yet—because the right data doesn’t exist. Exercising judgment about when to model, how to model, and when to hold back is what separates technically competent business scientists from strategic, decision-focused ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Planning Fresh Produce Orders at Coles\n\n\n\nImagine you’re helping Coles figure out how much fruit and vegetables to order each week. The goal is to keep the shelves stocked—but not waste food.\nYou start with something simple: looking at the average sales from past weeks. It works okay—until a public holiday or heatwave throws things off.\nNext, you try a more advanced method that also considers the season, day of the week, and weather. It works better, but someone suggests using a really complex model that nobody on the store team understands. You push back—because if the store managers don’t trust the numbers, they won’t use them.\nAnd for rare items with very little data, you decide not to build a model at all. You just show the trends in a simple chart.\nThe skill: A good business scientist knows when a simple method is enough, when a more advanced one helps, and when to just keep it clear and practical. It’s not about the flashiest tool—it’s about using the right tool for the problem.\n\n\n\n\n5. Analytical Theory: Know What Can Go Wrong\nWorking with data and analytical models is powerful—but it can also be risky. A misleading analysis can lead to the wrong decision, and in a business setting, that can be costly. Great business scientists are curious, but also careful. They think critically about whether the data and the method are really giving them the full picture.\nThis skill is closely connected to what you might hear in your statistics or quantitative methods classes: statistical thinking. It’s the habit of reasoning about data in a structured, careful way. It means questioning your results, spotting weak points in your reasoning, and understanding what your analysis can (and can’t) actually say.\nThat includes asking tough but important questions:\n\nAre we sure we’re measuring what we think we’re measuring?\nCould something else be causing this pattern?\nWould our conclusions change if we looked at different data—or looked at it a different way?\nWhat assumptions are we making—and are they reasonable for this situation?\n\nYou don’t need to know all the technical terms yet. What matters is developing the habit of looking under the hood. Sometimes your data leaves out important groups of people. Sometimes two things move together just by coincidence. Sometimes your analysis works well on past data but falls apart in the real world. The key idea is to always ask: What might I be missing, and how could that change the story the data appears to tell?\nThe best business scientists aren’t afraid to poke holes in their own work. They look for alternative explanations, check their assumptions, and clearly explain what their results do—and don’t—mean. That’s not being negative. That’s being honest about what the evidence actually supports. It’s what makes your work trustworthy—and it’s one of the most valuable habits you can develop. Some might say business scientists get a little too good at this—always finding what could go wrong. But don’t worry, it’s what makes your insights dependable, not just impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Did the Loyalty Program Really Work?\n\n\n\nSuppose a retailer launches a new loyalty program, and soon after, analysts notice that members are spending more than non-members. The initial report celebrates the program’s success.\nBut one analyst pauses: were customers spending more because of the program, or were the high spenders just more likely to sign up?\nThere was no clear before-and-after comparison. No comparison group who weren’t offered the option to sign-up. No test of whether the program caused the change. The team had found a pattern—but assumed it meant impact.\nAnalytical thinking in action: Good analysts don’t just spot patterns—they ask what explains them. Correlation alone isn’t enough. Without the right comparisons and reasoning, your analysis might be telling the wrong story.\n\n\n\n\n6. Computational Skills: Work with Code and Technology\nToday’s business scientists work with code. Languages like R allow you to clean data, test models, automate your workflow, and produce results that others can reproduce and build on. Knowing how to code doesn’t just make you faster—it makes your work clearer, more flexible, and more independent. You’re not waiting around for someone else to pull the data or run the analysis—you can do it yourself.\nBut this isn’t about becoming a software engineer. It’s about being comfortable enough with technology to solve data problems efficiently. That means knowing how to load data, reshape it, create useful visualisations, implement an analytical model, and document your process so that others can follow what you did.\nIt also means working across tools and platforms. Modern analytics happens in spreadsheets, databases, dashboards, cloud services, and version-controlled files. The specific tools will change over time—but the underlying mindset stays the same. Business scientists learn to break problems into steps, fix things when they break, and automate repetitive tasks so they can focus on the thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Learning to Code Is Like Learning to Cook\n\n\n\nThink of coding like learning to cook. At first, it can feel daunting—just like the first time you turn on the gas stove and see real flames and worry you might burn down the house. But once you get used to it, the heat becomes something you learn to control and use.\nEarly on, you follow recipes—step-by-step instructions written by others. You might not fully understand why something works, but you can still get a decent result.\nOver time, you start to improvise. You recognise patterns, adapt techniques, and build your own workflows. You learn to debug when something “burns,” and eventually, you create your own reusable recipes for solving data problems.\nYou don’t need to become a professional chef—or a software engineer. But having basic coding skills gives you independence, creativity, and confidence in the analytics kitchen.\n\n\n\n\n7. Presentation & Communication: Communicating what you find to non-specialists\nGreat insights don’t speak for themselves. You need to help them speak to others. Whether it’s through a graph, a dashboard, slide deck or a short written brief, business scientists shape their findings into clear, purposeful stories that help others understand what the data shows—and what to do about it.\nGood communication starts with your audience. What decisions are they trying to make? What do they need to know to move forward? Different audiences need different approaches. Executives often want clarity: What’s happening, and what should we do about it? Your fellow analysts might care more about the method, the data sources, or the assumptions you made. A great business scientist can move between both—zooming out to frame the big picture, or zooming in when detail matters.\nThis kind of communication isn’t about flashy visuals or technical jargon. It’s about structured thinking, clean presentation, and sharp writing. That means:\n\nDesigning graphs, tables and slides that show exactly what matters—no more, no less\nTelling a story with a beginning, middle, and end\nAnticipating questions before they’re asked\nHighlighting the recommendation, not just the result\n\nThe goal isn’t to impress people with how much you know. It’s to make it easier for them to think clearly, decide confidently, and take the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: The Executive Slide That Looked Like a Stats Exam\n\n\n\nA team prepares a presentation for senior leadership to explain the results of an A/B test. They include p-values, confidence intervals, model coefficients, and three dense charts about statistical assumptions.\nWhen they present, the executives skim the slide and ask, “So… should we roll out the new version or not?”\nThe analysis was solid—but the message didn’t land.\nThe lesson: Even the best results can fall flat if the audience can’t see the relevance. For decision-makers, lead with the insight—not the math.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📊 Example: The Analyst Who Got the ‘So What?’ Question\n\n\n\nAn analyst builds a clean, interactive dashboard showing churn rates across products and regions. They walk through the filters and visual options, confident in the design.\nBut when they present to a room of non-technical managers, someone interrupts: “This looks great—but what are we supposed to do with it?”\nThere’s no interpretation. No recommendation. Just data.\nThe lesson: A beautiful dashboard might not be enough for analytics focused audiences. If your audience can’t see what matters—or what to do—it won’t drive action.\n\n\n\n\n8. Creativity & Judgment: Asking the Right Questions\nBusiness analytics starts with curiosity. Before you can run any analysis, you need a question worth answering. Great business scientists don’t just respond to requests—they help shape them. They turn vague goals like “improve customer experience” or “reduce churn” into specific, testable questions that data can help resolve. Framing the problem is the first step toward solving it.\nThis takes both creativity and judgment. Creativity helps you see problems from new angles, reframe challenges, and imagine what might be possible. Judgment helps you filter: Which questions are actually worth answering? Which ones tie to real business decisions? The best questions are those that are both interesting and useful—they push thinking forward and point toward action.\nThis skill also involves timing. You won’t always be given a clean, well-defined problem to solve. Sometimes, the brief is too broad. Other times, the data reveals something surprising, and you have to decide whether it’s a meaningful lead or just noise. Knowing when to dig deeper and when to move on is part of the craft.\nThe best business scientists act like investigators. They notice when something doesn’t add up. They wonder about cause-and-effect relationships. They play out “what if” scenarios in their head before opening the dataset. This kind of curiosity—anchored by a strong sense of business relevance—is what helps them identify the questions that will lead to insights, and the insights that will lead to better decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: A Good Question Is Half the Work\n\n\n\nWhen you’re stuck in an analysis, take a step back and ask yourself:\nWhat exactly am I trying to learn—and why does it matter?\nGood business scientists don’t just dive into data—they pause to clarify the question. They ask things like:\n\nIs this question specific enough to answer?\nWhat would a useful answer look like?\nWho needs to make a decision based on this?\n\nFraming a question well often makes the rest of the analysis easier. It tells you what data to look for, what methods to use, and when you’re done.\n\n\n\n\n10 min\n\n\n📝 Check-In: Which Skills Do You Already Have?\nTake a moment to reflect.

    "text": "2.4 Applying and Combining the Skills\nNot every business scientist uses every skill in equal measure. Some of the skills you’ve just seen—like communicating clearly, thinking critically with data, or understanding the business context—will show up in nearly every project you work on. Others—like predictive modelling or building dashboards—depend more on your specific role, your team, or the kinds of problems you’re tackling.\nWhat we’ve offered so far is a starting point: a map of what it means to think and work like a business scientist. You won’t need to master all these skills overnight. But recognising which ones are foundational versus role- or project-specific can help you focus your development—and understand what makes different paths within analytics both challenging and rewarding.\nSome of these differences also help explain why people are drawn to different types of analytics work. If you enjoy testing ideas and running experiments, you might be interested in projects that compare what happens when a business changes something—like a website layout or a pricing offer. If you like explaining things and helping others make sense of data, you might prefer working on reports, dashboards, or presentations. And if you enjoy solving puzzles behind the scenes, you might gravitate toward tasks like cleaning data, building models, or improving how information flows through a system.\nIn what follows, we’ll explore how these skills show up across different kinds of analytics roles and how they come together in practice.\n\nUniversal Skills: Always Needed\nSome skills form the foundation of good analytics practice. They willshow up in nearly every project, across all industries, and regardless of what tools or techniques you use. Think of these as the core muscles of a business scientist—skills that support everything else.\nUnderstanding the Business World is perhaps the most universal skill of all. No analysis happens in a vacuum. Whether you’re writing a simple sales summary or building a complex model, you need to understand how the business works in order to interpret patterns and give your results meaning. Without this context, even technically correct analysis can lead to irrelevant—or misleading—conclusions.\nFinding the Right Data is just as essential. Good decisions require good inputs. Whether you’re scraping a website, querying a database, conducting a survey, or combining messy spreadsheets, the challenge is the same: figure out what information matters, and track it down. It’s not just about technical skills—it’s about knowing what to look for and why it matters.\nCommunicating What You Find is the bridge between analysis and action. If you can’t explain your findings in a clear and compelling way, your work won’t get used—no matter how insightful it is. Whether through graphs, slides, dashboards, or short write-ups, you need to help others understand what the data shows and what it means for them.\nAsking the Right Questions is what sets great analysts apart, and arguably the most useful of the universal skills. Every project begins with curiosity: Why is this happening? What should we try next? What don’t we know yet? Knowing how to frame a focused, answerable, and relevant question is a skill in itself—and one that applies to every kind of analytics work.\nTogether, these four skills show up again and again. They’re not tied to any one job title or toolset—they’re what make you effective, no matter where you apply them.\n\n\nRole- or Project-Specific Skills: Context-Dependent\nThe remaining skills become more or less important depending on your role, your industry, or the kind of problems you’re solving. This is where specialization begins—where business scientists develop deeper strengths based on what they do and where they work.\nUnderstanding People and Firms becomes especially important in roles focused on strategy, consulting, or customer insights—anywhere human behavior and incentives drive outcomes. If you’re investigating why customers leave, how employees react to policy changes, or how a competitor might respond to a price cut, this skill goes from helpful to essential.\nChoosing the Right Tool is crucial for roles that involve forecasting, optimization, or experimentation—like pricing analysts, risk managers, or product data scientists. In these roles, you’re not just analyzing past patterns—you’re building models that inform real decisions. That means knowing which method fits the question, the data, and the stakes.\nKnowing What Can Go Wrong becomes especially important when the decisions being made based on your analysis carry significant risk—whether that’s financial, reputational, or strategic. If your findings influence pricing changes, hiring decisions, product launches, or policy shifts, mistakes can be costly. In these situations, being able to identify assumptions, check for errors, and communicate uncertainty clearly isn’t just a bonus—it’s part of being a responsible business scientist.\nWorking with Code and Technology varies the most across roles. If you’re building data pipelines, automating reports, or working with big datasets, this skill is essential. But in roles focused more on communication or insight interpretation, you might rely more on pre-built dashboards or visual tools. Either way, having some comfort with code gives you flexibility and independence.\n\n\n2.4.1 Mini Case: Different Roles, Same Goal\nStreamly, a fictitious fast-scaling global music streaming service, has recently expanded into over a dozen countries across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. But something’s wrong—churn rates in some regions are much higher than expected. The executive team wants to know why users are leaving—and what can be done to retain them.\nThree different business scientists are brought in to investigate. Each brings a different background, focus, and skill mix. Their conclusions differ—but each adds a crucial piece of the puzzle:\n🤖 Product Data Scientist\nThe Data Scientist works with millions of user-level records. Using survival models and machine learning techniques, they identify early warning signs of churn. The models reveal that users who don’t engage with playlists or explore new genres in their first 10 days are much more likely to cancel. Their recommendation? Introduce smarter onboarding journeys that promote exploration and improve the relevance of recommendations.\nKey skills: Choose the Right Tool + Work with Code and Technology + Know What Can Go Wrong\n🌍 Consumer Insights Manager\nThe Consumer Insights Manager conducts interviews and analyzes survey data across regions. They uncover that musical tastes and content expectations differ widely. In some markets, users feel disconnected due to a lack of local artists or region-specific features like live event tie-ins. Their recommendation? Build stronger regional editorial teams and tailor content strategies to local cultures.\nKey skills: Understand People and Firms + Find the Right Data + Understand the Business World\n📊 Strategy and Operations Analyst\nThe Strategy and Operations Analyst benchmarks Streamly’s pricing, bundling, and distribution models against local competitors. Their research shows that high-churn markets often feature competitors with more flexible plans—like student discounts or weekly passes. Their insight? Product-market fit includes price. Their recommendation? Introduce locally responsive pricing structures.\nKey skills: Understand the Business World + Ask the Right Questions + Understand People and Firms\n\n\n10 min\n\n\n📝 Check-In: Questions for Reflection\n\nWhat kind of analyst would you most want to be in this situation? Why?\nIf you were leading the project, how would you decide which recommendation to prioritize first?\nAre there any skills missing from this team that could make the solution even stronger?\nHow might cultural differences, platform design, or competitive strategy interact in ways that none of the analysts saw on their own?\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nDifferent skill combinations reveal different dimensions of the same problem. True impact often comes from integrating insights across roles. Business scientists don’t just answer questions—they collaborate to shape better ones.\nWhile every business scientist needs a broad foundation across all eight skills, your role and interests will naturally shape which ones you develop most deeply. One size doesn’t fit all—but every project needs strong fundamentals.\nAs you progress in your career, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward certain types of problems that align with your strongest skills. That’s not just natural—it’s strategic. The best analysts understand their own capabilities and seek out projects where they can have the greatest impact.\nThe goal isn’t to be equally strong in everything. It’s to be strong enough in the fundamentals to be effective anywhere, while developing specialized expertise in the areas that matter most for the work you want to do.",

    "section": "2.5 Building a Versatile Skill Set",
    "text": "2.5 Building a Versatile Skill Set\nDeveloping as a business scientist is a marathon, not a sprint. The eight skills you’ve just explored offer a roadmap—but no one masters all of them at once. Some will feel intuitive from the start. Others may take time, practice, and the right context to develop. The key is to build systematically, not randomly: start with a clear sense of where you are, where you want to go, and how your skills align with the kinds of problems you’re most excited to solve.\n\nHow to Identify Which Skills to Develop\nStart with an self-assessment. Reflect on projects you’ve worked on—in class, during internships, or in previous roles. What parts came naturally? Where did you struggle? This isn’t about self-criticism—it’s about gaining insight into your current strengths and identifying areas for growth.\nFor each of the eight skills, think of one time you used it well, and one time you wished you were stronger. Maybe you’re great at spotting patterns in messy datasets, but find it difficult to communicate your findings to non-technical audiences. Or perhaps you have strong intuition about business problems, but aren’t confident choosing the right analytical method.\nOnce you’ve taken stock of your skills, look ahead. What kinds of roles interest you? Not just job titles—but the actual day-to-day work. A “data analyst” at a government agency might focus on policy dashboards and stakeholder communication. That same title in a tech startup might involve coding, experimentation, and product analytics. Research job postings, talk to people in roles that intrigue you, and pay attention to which skills show up again and again. Look beyond technical requirements—many roles quietly demand strengths in business understanding, communication, and good judgment.\nNow that you’ve reflected, you have the start of the game plan. You know which skills you want to develop. Now its about developing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Revisit Your Skills Over Time\n\n\n\nYour interests will evolve. So will your strengths.\nCome back to this self-assessment exercise at key points in your journey— such as in the middle or at the end of this or other courses, after an internship, before you start your first job or when you are looking for a new job. You’ll often discover new strengths you didn’t know you had, or areas you’ve grown in more than expected.\nAs you try different kinds of work and collaborate with people who bring out different sides of you, you’ll get a better sense of what energizes you—and what kind of business scientist you’re becoming.\nThink of this as your personal skill map. Update it often.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Skills Over Time\nThe temptation is often to chase the flashiest skills first. But the strongest business scientists build from the ground up. Focus on the fundamentals before diving deep.\nStart with the four universal skills:\n\nUnderstanding the business world\nFinding the right data\nCommunicating clearly\nAsking the right questions\n\nThese aren’t optional extras—they’re the foundation that makes every other skill more effective. You can’t choose the right model without understanding the problem. You can’t drive action if you can’t explain your findings well. Throughout this book you will be using these skills in every chapter and in every tutorial exercise.\nAs these foundations grow are solid, choose one or two specialization areas to develop more deeply. If you’re drawn to strategy, focus on business theory and behavioral insight. If you love solving technical puzzles, work on analytical modeling and computational skills. We will help you develop each of these gradually over the following chapters, by introducing you to business problems that need theoretical underpinnings and developing your analytical skills to answer these business problems with data and code. While this book blends these two components equally to build uo your foundational knowlegde, as you continue your journey towards becoming a business scientist you can choose how to specialize further.\nHere’s how to approach skill development practically:\nThrough Projects: The best learning happens when you’re trying to solve real problems. Seek out opportunities to work on projects that stretch your capabilities. Volunteer for analyses that require skills you want to develop. Take on side projects that let you experiment with new tools or techniques.\nThrough Courses: Formal learning provides structure and depth. But choose courses strategically. If you’re weak on fundamentals, prioritize business courses, statistics, and communication training over advanced machine learning. If you’re strong on basics, dive deeper into specialized areas.\nThrough Collaboration: Work with people whose skills complement yours. Partner with someone who’s strong where you’re weak. Watch how experienced analysts approach problems. Ask questions about their process, not just their conclusions.\nThrough Reflection: Periodically spend time thinking about what went well and what didn’t. Which skills made the biggest difference? Where did you get stuck? What would you do differently next time? This reflection turns experience into expertise.\nRemember: skill development never stops. Technology changes, industries evolve, and new analytical methods emerge. The goal isn’t to master everything once—it’s to build a foundation that lets you adapt and grow throughout your career. The best business scientists are curious, self-aware, and strategic about their development. They know their strengths, understand their gaps, and actively work to expand their capabilities. Most importantly, they never stop learning.",

    "section": "2.6 The Business Analytics Workflow",
    "text": "2.6 The Business Analytics Workflow\nNow that we’ve seen how different skill combinations shape the way analysts think and work, it’s almost time to put those skills into action. The workflow we’re about to explore offers a structured—but adaptable—way to move from a vague business problem to a clear, evidence-based recommendation. It helps ensure you approach problems with the same mindset as a business scientist: curious, critical, and creative.\nThink of this workflow as your analytical GPS. Just like navigation software, it provides a reliable route while allowing for detours when you discover something unexpected. The workflow doesn’t follow a strict linear order—you might go back and forth between steps as your understanding deepens. That’s not a flaw, it’s part of what makes this process powerful.\nMore importantly, each step in the workflow draws on the skills you’ve been learning about. You’ll see how “Ask the Right Questions” drives the first step, how “Find the Right Data” and “Work with Code and Technology” power the middle steps, and how “Communicate What You Find” brings everything together at the end.\nBelow, we walk through each stage:\n\n1. Define the Business Question and Plan Outputs\nEvery good analysis starts with a clear question. What are we trying to understand, predict, or change? Defining the business question forces clarity about what matters. Just as important is imagining what the final output might look like—a chart, a dashboard, a decision. By sketching the destination, we can plan a smarter route to get there.\nWe also ask: what does success look like? Who is this analysis for? What would make it useful? This step is where your ability to Ask the Right Questions and Understand the Business World becomes crucial.\n\n\n2. Acquire and Prepare the Data\nOnce we know what we’re looking for, we gather the data that might help us find it. This step includes locating sources, cleaning messy files, checking for missing values, and creating new variables that capture meaningful patterns. Preparing data well isn’t glamorous—but it’s where most of the hard work happens. And doing it right sets everything else up for success.\nHere’s where Find the Right Data and Work with Code and Technology take center stage.\n\n\n3. Explore and Visualize Patterns\nBefore jumping into advanced methods, we take time to understand the data through visualization and summary statistics. What do distributions look like? Are there surprising trends or outliers? Do any relationships jump out? This stage is about seeing what the data wants to tell us—and starting to form hypotheses we might want to test more formally.\nThis exploratory phase draws on multiple skills: Ask the Right Questions (what patterns might exist?), Understand People and Firms (do these patterns make business sense?), and Know What Can Go Wrong (are we seeing real patterns or just noise?).\n\n\n4. Analyze and Interpret Findings\nWith a clearer view of the patterns, we bring in formal analytical tools. This might mean running regressions, building prediction models, or estimating causal effects. But analysis doesn’t end with numbers. We need to interpret those numbers in business terms. What do they mean for the question we started with? Do they hold up under scrutiny? Have we validated the results and checked our assumptions?\nThis is where Choose the Right Tool and Know What Can Go Wrong become essential, supported by your understanding of the business context.\n\n\n5. Communicate Insights and Recommendations\nFinally, we present our findings. Not just the numbers—but the story they tell. This includes choosing clear visuals, tailoring the message to our audience, and offering concrete recommendations. A good presentation doesn’t just report—it persuades. It helps others act.\nThe culmination of everything: Communicate What You Find backed by all the analytical rigor that came before.\nTogether, these five steps form a flexible but disciplined approach to solving problems with data. You’ll return to this workflow throughout the course—and throughout your career. Each time you use it, you’ll get better at knowing which skills to emphasize at which stages, and how to adapt the process to different types of business challenges.",

    "text": "2.7 Analytics in the Age of Generative AI\nWe’re living through a remarkable moment in business analytics. Artificial intelligence can now write code, generate reports, create visualizations, and even propose business recommendations. For many students, this raises an uncomfortable question: if AI can do analytics, why do we need human analysts?\nThe answer lies in what AI can and cannot do—and why the analytics mindset becomes even more important, not less, in an AI-powered world.\n\nAI and the Analytics Mindset: Why Human Judgment Still Matters\nAI has transformed many parts of analytics. It can summarize findings, generate visualizations, and surface patterns in huge datasets. But it doesn’t yet understand business context. It doesn’t yet know what matters most or how decisions will actually get made. These missing pieces aren’t minor details; they’re central to the business scientist’s job. To see the difference, imagine you take a photo of an important artwork at a museum and ask an AI to explain it to your grandmother. The AI might describe the colors, objects, and even name the painter. But it won’t know why that artwork moves you, or what personal story it tells in your family.\nIn the same way, AI might correctly identify a dip in satisfaction scores—but it won’t know that your company just restructured, or that the drop is actually better than where things were six months ago. This is where human analysts shine. We can interpret AI-generated findings with context, judgment, and awareness of organizational realities. We know when something “doesn’t smell right,” when results are promising but politically difficult, or when a finding isn’t actionable even if it’s true.\nWithout that human touch, AI outputs too often becoming sophisticated noise.\n\n\nAI as a Tool, Not a Replacement\nIt’s tempting to see AI as a magic fix for analytics. But giving someone AI without critical thinking is like handing them a sports car without teaching them to drive. The car is powerful. But without a skilled driver, it’s more dangerous than useful.\nAI is a powerful assistant, not a decision-maker. Here’s how the roles split:\nAI excels at: crunching, or giving you advice on how to crunch large datasets, finding patterns, generating charts, drafting code, and automating tasks.\nHumans excel at: understanding business context, framing questions, judging quality, interpreting ambiguity, and communicating insights with nuance.\nStrong analysts use AI to speed up routine work so they can focus on the harder thinking. They validate outputs, test alternatives, and guide the AI toward useful paths. They remain in the driver’s seat.\n\n\nWhat This Means for Your Development\nRather than making human analysts obsolete, AI raises the bar. Some core skills that we discussed in this chapter become more valuable:\n\nAsk the Right Questions: AI can answer anything—but it can’t tell you which questions matter.\nUnderstand the Business World: AI doesn’t grasp context or strategy. You do.\nKnow What Can Go Wrong: AI is confident, even when wrong. Someone needs to spot the flaws.\nCommunicate What You Find: AI can’t read the room, persuade a team, or tailor a story to your boss.\n\n\n\nLooking Forward: The AI-Augmented Analyst\nThe business scientists who thrive won’t compete with AI—they’ll collaborate with it. They’ll use AI to explore ideas, check assumptions, and speed up their workflow. But they’ll bring what AI can’t: human insight.\nAI is raising the baseline. The value you bring lies in your ability to think clearly, communicate well, and make decisions that account for real-world complexity. That’s the business scientist mindset—and it’s more important now than ever.",

    "text": "2.8 What’s Next?\nYou now have the foundation every business scientist needs: a clear understanding of the eight core skills and a structured workflow for approaching problems. More importantly, you understand that business analytics isn’t just about technical tools—it’s about thinking clearly and asking smart questions in service of better decisions.\nBut understanding the framework is just the beginning. The real learning happens when you start getting your hands dirty with actual data.\n\nFrom Theory to Practice\nIn the chapters ahead, you’ll stop reading about analytics and start doing it. You’ll work with real datasets from companies across different industries. Each project will give you the chance to practice different aspects of the workflow:\n\nYou’ll wrestle with messy, incomplete data and learn how to clean it systematically\nYou’ll explore datasets to uncover unexpected patterns and form hypotheses about what’s driving them\n\nYou’ll choose analytical methods that match your questions and learn when simple approaches work better than complex ones\nYou’ll create visualizations that actually communicate insights rather than just displaying numbers\nYou’ll present findings to different audiences and discover how the same analysis can be framed in multiple ways\n\n\n\nBuilding Your Analytical Intuition\nReading about the analytics mindset is one thing; developing it is another. As you work through upcoming projects, you’ll start to build the intuition that experienced analysts rely on—that sense of when something doesn’t look right, when to dig deeper, and when you’ve found something worth acting on.\nYou will make mistakes. Your first attempts at data cleaning will probably miss important issues or generate many error messages. Your initial hypotheses will sometimes be completely wrong. You’ll create charts that confuse rather than clarify. That’s not just normal—it is a necessary part of the learning process. Each mistake teaches you something that no textbook can.\nYou’ll also experience those breakthrough moments when everything clicks—when a pattern emerges from seemingly random data, when you finally understand what’s driving a business problem, or when you present an insight that genuinely changes how someone thinks about their business. Those moments are what make all the technical learning worthwhile.",

How does that shape the analysis?\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Exploring Last Year’s Data\nThe team now wants to use last year’s data to improve inventory decisions for the upcoming holiday season.\nAs the new group of analysts in the company, you’ve been asked to review what happened and make recommendations for this year’s strategy.\nThe data you have to work from are provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek Commencing\nRegion\nStarting Inventory\nUnits Delivered\nUnits Sold\nEnding Inventory\nPrice (AUD)\nPromotion (Y/N)\n\n\n\n\n25 Nov\nSydney\n500\n100\n100\n500\n50\nN\n\n\n25 Nov\nMelbourne\n500\n100\n150\n450\n50\nN\n\n\n2 Dec\nSydney\n500\n100\n180\n420\n45\nY\n\n\n2 Dec\nMelbourne\n450\n100\n220\n330\n45\nY\n\n\n9 Dec\nSydney\n420\n100\n150\n370\n45\nY\n\n\n9 Dec\nMelbourne\n330\n100\n100\n330\n45\nY\n\n\n16 Dec\nSydney\n370\n100\n400\n70\n40\nY (Christmas)\n\n\n16 Dec\nMelbourne\n330\n100\n400\n30\n40\nY (Christmas)\n\n\n23 Dec\nSydney\n70\n100\n120\n50\n50\nN\n\n\n23 Dec\nMelbourne\n30\n100\n150\n-20 (backorder)\n50\nN\n\n\n\nFollow the three-step approach below to draw conclusions about what happened in the previous year.\n\nStep 1: Observe\n\nWhat patterns do you notice in sales over time?\nHow do price changes and the Christmas promotion relate to changes in sales?\nWhat differences stand out between Sydney and Melbourne?\n\n\n\nStep 2: Analyse\n\nHow well is the fixed restocking rule working in each region?\nWhen did inventory levels become risky?\nWere there signs earlier in the data that could have helped predict this?\n\n\n\nStep 3: Predict & Explain\n\nIf nothing changes, what do you expect to happen next week?\nWhat factors might be driving the differences between the two regions?\nWhat other data would help you explain or predict these patterns more confidently?\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8: Planning for This Year’s Holiday Season\nDavid Jones’ supplier is asking you to confirm delivery quantities now, so they can prepare for the season ahead.\n\nHow many units should you order for Sydney and Melbourne for the first week of the holiday season?\nJustify your decision based on last year’s patterns and your reasoning. Consider factors like demand trends, regional differences, price effects, and promotion timing.\nSuppose the supplier has limited capacity and can only supply 200 units total for the first week. How would you allocate this stock between Sydney and Melbourne? What are the risks of your choice?\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Presenting to Management\nImagine you are presenting your recommendation on what to order now to David Jones’ management team.\nWrite 2–3 sentences summarising:\n\nWhat you saw in the data from last year\nWhat you recommend\nWhy this matters for the business\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Reflection\n\nWhich skills of a business data analyst did you use today?\nWhich steps of the business analytics workflow did you go through?\nDid you adopt descriptive, predictive or causal perspectives in your analyses?\nHow did your perspectives differ from other groups and how did this change the approach and results?",

    "text": "The Business Challenge\nUber is facing a new challenge in cities like Sydney and Melbourne. Some drivers have found a way to game the surge pricing system by temporarily logging off in groups to reduce supply. This triggers a surge in prices—and when they log back in, they benefit from higher fares.\nWhile this behavior doesn’t technically break any rules, it raises serious concerns. Should Uber treat it as clever strategy or as manipulation? Should it intervene—and if so, how? Cracking down too hard could upset drivers and hurt morale. Doing nothing might damage rider trust and public perception.\nUber’s analytics and operations teams need to investigate what’s really going on, what’s driving this behavior, and whether (and how) to respond in a way that balances fairness, incentives, and platform health.",

    "text": "Prepare these Exercises before Class\nPrepare these exercises before coming to class. Plan to spend 30 minutes on these exercises.\n\nExercise 1: Identifying the key concepts\nWatch this short news story: “Uber drivers creating artificial surge prices” (ABC News, 29 July 2025).\nIn your own words, define the following key terms or ideas mentioned in the article:\n\nSurge pricing\nAlgorithmic pricing\nPlatform manipulation\nDriver incentives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to provide formal or technical definitions. Focus on explaining each concept in your own words, based on how it was used in the video.\n\n\nWrite your answer here\n\n\nExercise 2: Explaining Context and Identifying a Research Question\nUber’s pricing system is designed to respond to real-time supply and demand. But as the video shows, driver behavior can complicate this—sometimes in ways the algorithm wasn’t built to anticipate.\nImagine you’re part of a team investigating the situation in Sydney and Melbourne.\nIn 3–4 sentences, explain how you would define the problem for Uber. Then, write one clear research question that your team could use to guide further analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo help you think through this, you might want to consider the following:\n\nWhat’s really going wrong here?\nWhy does it matter to the business?\nWhat kind of evidence or data would help clarify the situation?\n\n\n\nWrite your answer here\n\n\nExercise 3: How to answer the question?\nYour manager turns to you and says:\n\n“Where should we start?”\n\nIn 3–5 bullet points, outline how you would approach the problem as a business scientist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo help you think through this, you may want to integrate answers from the following questions:\n\nWhat business or consumer theories might help you?\nWhat data would you want?\nWhat kind of methods might be useful?\n\n\n\nWrite your answer here",

    "text": "In-Class Exercises\nYou will discuss these exercises in class with your peers in small groups and with your tutor. The first few exercises build from the exercises you have prepared above, you will get the most value from the class if you have completed those above before coming to class. The latter exercises are designed to help you get more comfortable using PositCloud.\n\nExercise 4: Defining a Problem and Crafting Questions\n\nShare your business context descriptions and research questions (from Question 2) with your group.\nAs a group, discuss:\n\n\nWhich context descriptions are clear and well-framed?\nWhich research questions are answerable using data?\nWhich questions are most likely to help Uber make a better decision?\n\n\nChoose the best research question your group came up with. Write down the question and explain why you chose it. What makes it clear, useful, or powerful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversation prompt\n\n\n\nAre your group’s questions descriptive (what happened), predictive (what will happen), or causal (why did it happen)? How does that shape the analysis?\n\n\nWrite your answer here\n\n\nExercise 5: Sketching Out the Way Forward\n\nShare your bullet point responses to Question 3 (“Where should we start?”) with your group.\nAs a group, discuss:\n\n\nWhich responses feel realistic and well thought-through?\nWhich ones show a good understanding of how business context and data interact?\nWhich approaches would be easiest to communicate to a stakeholder who doesn’t know the data?\n\n\nChoose the group member’s response that you think offers the strongest starting point. Write it down and explain why—what makes it practical, well-reasoned, or insightful?\n\nWrite your answer here\n\n\nExercise 6: Logging into PositCloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Pivot\n\n\n\nIn this week’s Workshop we are pivoting midway through to give you more time to get comfortable with the computing environment for this class, PositCloud.\nWe know this is a sudden pivot in content. In future weeks, we don’t anticipate sudden jumps in content in the middle of a session.\n\n\nLog in to Posit Cloud and launch your project.\n\nGo to https://posit.cloud and log in using your university credentials.\nNavigate to the “CMCE 10002 - 2025 Semester 2” Space on the left sidebar.\nFind the project titled “Tutorial 2”.\nClick “Make a Copy”.\nWait for the RStudio session to finish loading — you should see the Console, Files, and Environment panes.\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Make Some Edits to Your Quarto Document\n\nAt the top of the document, in the YAML header, change the author field to your full name.\nEdit the sentence below sentence so:\n\nOne word is bold by wrapping it in double asterisks: **like this**\nAnother word italic by wrapping it in single asterisks: *like this*\n\nAdd a new R code chunk that computes the answer to 2+2 and returns the answer:\nAdd another R code chunk that stores the answer to 2+2 a variable called my_answer and prints it.\nRender the document and see the changes you have made.\n\nEDIT THIS: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\n\nExercise 8: Write Your Own Code\n\nAdd new code chunk to store a vector, called my_vector that contains each of the numbers 1 through 5. You can produce that vector using c(1,2,3,4,5)\nCalculate the mean of my_vector by applying the mean() function.\nAdd a comment above your code that computes the mean to describe what it does. You can add a comment using the hashtag to start a line inside an R chunk like this # This is a comment\nNow use the Console to search for help on the function that returns the median value in a numeric vector, ?median.",
