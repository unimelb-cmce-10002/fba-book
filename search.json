    "text": "Welcome\nIn this course, you’ll develop the essential skills to analyze and interpret data for better business decision-making. Whether you’re new to coding or looking to strengthen your analytical thinking, we’ll guide you through the fundamentals of working with data in R — structuring, transforming, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting information effectively.\nBusiness analytics spans three critical dimensions: understanding what happened in the past, anticipating what will happen next, and uncovering why things happen through causal analysis. Through hands-on case studies, you’ll apply these approaches to real-world business problems, extracting meaningful insights that drive action. The power of data lies in the stories it tells. From ancient oral traditions to modern visualizations, effectively communicated insights create impact. You’ll learn to transform raw data into compelling narratives that enhance clarity and directly influence business decisions.\nYour approach will mirror that of a scientist: observing carefully, experimenting methodically, and making evidence-based predictions about firm and consumer behavior. This systematic framework provides a practical toolkit for addressing complex business challenges. With this analytical power comes significant responsibility. We’ll explore ethical dimensions of working with sensitive information, recognizing and mitigating bias, balancing analytical insight with individual rights, and ensuring transparent communication of findings.\nFor knowledge to create value, it must be communicated clearly and transparently. You’ll develop workflows that ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability — critical skills for building trust in your analysis.\nData is everywhere, but enduring insights are rare. This course will help you transform numbers into knowledge that informs business and society—ethically, responsibly, and effectively.",

    "text": "1.1 What is Business Analytics?\nBusinesses have always had to make important decisions: Who should we hire? Where should we invest? How much should we spend on advertising? In the past, these decisions were often made based on experience, intuition, or the authority of senior leadership—a dynamic sometimes known as the “HIPPO” effect: Highest Paid Person’s Opinion.\nThat’s no longer enough. Today’s businesses operate in faster, more complex environments. Fortunately, they also have access to something that previous generations did not: data. From customer transactions to social media posts, microsecond stock price information to supply chain records, nearly every part of a business now generates data. A single online purchase creates dozens of data points: what the customer viewed, how long they hesitated, which payment method they chose, even how they arrived at the site. The challenge isn’t collecting it—it’s knowing what to do with it.\nThis is where business analytics comes in.\nBusiness analytics is the use of data and analytical tools to support better decision-making. It combines statistical thinking, technological capability, and business insight. But it’s not just about building models or generating dashboards. At its core, it’s about helping organizations answer the fundamental question that drives all business strategy: What should we do next?\nThat story is ultimately what business analytics is trying to uncover. Analysts help businesses listen to what the data is saying—about customer needs, regulatory risks, investor sentiment, competitive dynamics, or operational bottlenecks—and translate that into actions.\nBut the essence of decision-making remains what it has always been: reasoning through uncertainty, weighing trade-offs, and telling a compelling story about what to do. The difference today is that we can do it better—with data as our guide, structure as our method, and analytical tools that help us move beyond educated guesswork toward informed action.",

    "section": "1.2 How Business Decision-Making Has Evolved",
    "text": "1.2 How Business Decision-Making Has Evolved\nBusiness decision-making has gone through a quiet revolution. While the core challenge—deciding what to do—hasn’t changed, the tools, habits, and expectations surrounding decision-making have shifted dramatically. Business analytics sits at the center of this transformation.\nWe can think of the evolution in four broad stages:\nStage 1: Gut Instinct (The HIPPO Era)\nFor most of the 20th century, decisions were dominated by experience, instinct, and authority. The most senior person in the room often had the final say—regardless of what the data might suggest. This is the “HIPPO” model we mentioned earlier: Highest Paid Person’s Opinion. While experience remains valuable, this approach often lacks transparency and makes it difficult to learn from both successes and failures.\nStage 2: Simple Data Support\nWith the rise of digital systems, businesses began generating and storing data—and using it to create basic reports and forecasts. Dashboards and spreadsheets became common tools for tracking performance. But in this stage, data was mainly descriptive: it helped explain what had happened, not what to do next. Think monthly sales reports or annual budget reviews.\nStage 3: Advanced Analytics\nAs computing power increased, so did analytical ambition. Businesses began using predictive models and machine learning to forecast future outcomes and identify hidden patterns. This allowed for more proactive decisions—anticipating which customers might leave, deciding when to issue stock to raise capital, or optimizing prices dynamically. Yet even the most sophisticated model is only as useful as the decision it ultimately supports.\nStage 4: Experimentation and Causal Learning\nThe frontier today is not just prediction—it’s learning what actually works. Companies now use A/B testing, field experiments, and causal inference to evaluate strategies and understand the true impact of different choices. This lets firms go beyond correlation and ask the crucial question: What happens if we actually do X instead of Y?\n\n“At Netflix, every decision is backed by an experiment.” — Track down who\n\n\n“Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.” — Jeff Bezos\n\nThis shift toward experimentation represents more than just a technical advancement—it’s a cultural transformation. It reflects a mindset that values curiosity, iteration, and evidence over hierarchy or habit. Modern business analytics is as much about learning and adapting as it is about measuring and predicting.",

    "text": "1.3 What is Business Analytics?\nWe’ve spent quite a bit of time talking about business analytics without actually defining it. Time to fix that.\nBusiness Analytics is the practice of using data and models to solve business problems and improve decision-making.\nIt’s not just about collecting numbers—it’s about using them wisely. In today’s data-rich environment, the real challenge is knowing how to extract insight, frame decisions, and take action in a way that creates value.\n\n“Data are widely available; what is scarce is the ability to extract wisdom from them.” — Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google\n\nThat’s where business analytics comes in. It combines technical skills with business understanding to move from raw data to real-world impact. A business analyst doesn’t just answer what happened—they help organizations understand why, predict what might happen next, and evaluate what to do about it.\nThe process usually involves five key steps:\n\nDefining the Problem — Every good analysis begins with a sharp question. What decision needs to be made? What are the options? What does success look like?\nCollecting and Cleaning Data — Data is rarely ready to use out of the box. Analysts spend significant time gathering relevant data sources and ensuring they’re accurate, complete, and reliable.\nAnalyzing Data Appropriately — With the right tools—from simple summaries to predictive models—analysts identify patterns, test hypotheses, and quantify trade-offs.\nCommunicating Insights — Even the best analysis fails if no one understands it. Analysts must tell persuasive, relatable stories with data—stories that clarify the decision at hand and guide action.\nActing to Create Value — Ultimately, analytics only matters if it leads to better decisions. The goal is not analysis for its own sake, but to generate insights that drive strategy, improve operations, control costs, better serve customers, or deliver stronger returns to shareholders.\n\nBusiness analytics is more than a technical field—it’s a way of thinking. It reflects a broader evolution in business: away from gut instinct alone, and toward evidence-based decision-making. But even as the tools evolve—from dashboards to machine learning to experimentation—the fundamental goal remains the same: to make smarter, more confident choices in an uncertain world.",

    "section": "1.4 The Three Types of Business Analytics",
    "text": "1.4 The Three Types of Business Analytics\nBusiness analytics isn’t one-size-fits-all. Different business problems require different types of insight—and therefore, different analytical tools. A helpful way to understand the field is to distinguish between three broad types of business analytics:\n\n1.4.1 Descriptive Analytics: What happened?\nDescriptive analytics focuses on summarizing and reporting what has already occurred in a business. It answers questions like:\n\nWhat were our total sales last quarter?\nWhich products had the highest return rates?\nWhat were the top 10 ASX-listed companies by shareholder return last year?\n\nTools used here include summary statistics, tables, visualizations, and dashboards. These methods don’t make predictions or test strategies—they organize past data in a way that helps managers understand performance, spot trends, or identify anomalies.\nThink of this as the rearview mirror of analytics. It helps you see where you’ve been.\n\n\n1.4.2 Predictive Analytics: What might happen next?\nPredictive analytics goes a step further: it uses past data to forecast future outcomes. This includes questions like:\n\nHow many customers are likely to churn next month?\nHow are annual depreciation expenses likely to change over the next three years?\nWill the RBA cut interest rates next month, and if so by how many basis points?\n\nMethods here often involve statistical models and machine learning techniques that identify patterns and extrapolate them forward. These models don’t guarantee what will happen, but they give decision-makers a probabilistic view of likely outcomes.\nImportantly, predictive models do not answer causal questions. A forecast that sales will increase next quarter doesn’t tell you why—or what would happen if you changed your pricing or launched a new campaign.\nThink of this as the weather forecast of analytics: useful for planning, but not a substitute for experimentation or causal understanding.\n\n\n1.4.3 Causal (Prescriptive) Analytics: What will happen if we act?\nThis is where things get more strategic—and more difficult.\nCausal analytics (sometimes called prescriptive analytics) tries to answer counterfactual questions: What would happen if we did X instead of Y?\nExamples include:\n\nWhat impact will a 10% price increase have on demand?\nHow will merging with another firm affect our share price?\nWould switching to a new supplier improve delivery times?\n\nThese questions can’t be answered by simply observing correlations or running a predictive model. They require methods designed to isolate cause and effect—such as randomized experiments (A/B testing), instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, or other econometric techniques.\nThis is the decision engine of analytics: it helps businesses not just anticipate the future, but change it deliberately.\n\n\n1.4.4 Key Insight: Different Problems, Different Tools\nEach type of analytics serves a different purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nCore Question\nTypical Tools\nBusiness Use\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive\nWhat happened?\nSummaries, visualizations\nReporting and monitoring\n\n\nPredictive\nWhat might happen?\nForecasting, classification\nAnticipating future trends\n\n\nCausal (Prescriptive)\nWhat will happen if we act?\nExperiments, causal inference\nStrategy and decision-making\n\n\n\nChoosing the wrong tool for the question can lead to misleading conclusions. For example, a model that predicts which companies are likely to identify and correct mistakes in their previously published financial statements is not the same as understanding why those mistakes occurred—or what internal controls or governance changes might have prevented them.\nTo be a great business analyst, it’s not enough to know how to use the tools. You need to know which tool matches which question.\n\n\n10 min\n\n\nMatching Analytics Types to Business Questions\nNow that you understand the three types of business analytics, let’s practice identifying which type of analysis different business questions require.\nFor each business area below, we’ve provided examples of questions that fall into our three categories: Descriptive (What happened?), Predictive (What might happen?), and Causal (What will happen if we act?).\nSome examples are filled in to get you started. Your job is to complete the missing entries by thinking about what questions a business analyst in each area might ask.\n\n\nComplete the Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Area\nDescriptive\nPredictive\nCausal\n\n\n\n\nSales\nHow much did we sell last quarter?\n[Your turn: What might happen in the future?]\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\nMarketing\n[Your turn: What happened in the past?]\nWho will buy next?\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\nHiring\n[Your turn: What happened in the past?]\n[Your turn: What might happen in the future?]\nWhat if we change recruitment practices?\n\n\nFinance\n[Your turn: What happened in the past?]\nWill we meet next quarter’s revenue goals?\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\nSupply Chain\nHow many units were delivered on time?\n[Your turn: What might happen in the future?]\n[Your turn: What question would test the impact of changing something?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 min\n\n\nClassify These Questions\nFor each question below, identify whether it requires Descriptive, Predictive, or Causal analytics:\n\n“Which marketing channels generated the most leads last month?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“How will our share price change if we replace our CEO with our current COO?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Which customers are most likely to upgrade to our premium service?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Which of our product lines account for the largest share of corporate overhead expenses?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Would offering free shipping increase our conversion rate?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n“Will analysts issue a buy/hold/sell recommendation for our stock next week?”\n\nType: _______________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking Like an Analyst\n\n\n\nRemember: the same business problem can often be approached from multiple analytical angles. The key is being intentional about which type of analysis will best serve the decision you need to make.",

    "section": "1.5 The Power and Limits of Analytics",
    "text": "1.5 The Power and Limits of Analytics\nBusiness analytics is a powerful tool—but it is not a crystal ball. At its best, analytics sharpens our thinking, clarifies options, and supports better decisions. But it also has limits that every analyst must understand.\n\n1.5.1 Good decisions depend on good data\nIt’s a simple principle, but an essential one: garbage in, garbage out. Even the most advanced model cannot save an analysis built on poor-quality data, vague problem definitions, or biased assumptions. Clean, relevant, well-structured data is a prerequisite—not a guarantee—for good insights.\n\nPrinciple: Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nAnalytics doesn’t make decisions for us. It supports decision-making. The quality of that support depends entirely on the inputs we provide and the care with which we interpret the results.\nThis is why, later in the course, we devote specific chapters to how data is collected and how it is stored and managed—because those choices shape everything that follows in the analytical process.\n\n\n1.5.2 Analytics doesn’t eliminate uncertainty—or judgment\nAll models are simplifications. They help us focus on what matters, but they also leave things out. A forecast can offer probabilities, but never certainties. A causal estimate can quantify impact, but only under specific assumptions. The world is more complex than any spreadsheet or statistical model can fully capture.\nThis means that even with data:\n\nUncertainty remains. Analysts must often make decisions under incomplete information or ambiguous results.\nTrade-offs persist. No model can resolve tensions between short-term gains and long-term investments, or between efficiency and innovation. These are managerial choices, not statistical ones.\nJudgment is essential. Good analysts don’t just run models—they think critically, question results, and tell coherent stories that connect the data to the broader context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: When Forecasting Falls Short\n\n\n\nWoolworths, Australia’s largest supermarket chain, learned this lesson during the ACCC’s 2024-25 supermarket inquiry. Despite having access to massive amounts of checkout data and sophisticated forecasting systems, Woolworths admitted to significant shortcomings in the accuracy of volume forecasts provided to fresh fruit and vegetable suppliers.\nAs CEO Amanda Bardwell acknowledged during ACCC hearings, the company had access to detailed checkout data that should have given them “a firm understanding of likely future demand.” Yet former Managing Director Natalie Davis admitted that an internal review found Woolworths had “failed to provide volume forecasts to suppliers that were as accurate as possible.”\nThe problem wasn’t the technology—it was how they used their data. Davis explained that Woolworths had failed to apply new analytical capabilities as they became available, essentially letting their forecasting methods lag behind their data collection abilities.\nKey lessons:\n\nGarbage in, garbage out: Having lots of data doesn’t automatically lead to good predictions\nTools must match the problem: Fresh produce forecasting requires different approaches than predicting demand for shelf-stable goods\nImplementation matters: Even good analytical capabilities are useless if they’re not properly applied\n\nSource: ACCC Supermarket Inquiry Final Report, March 2025\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 The analyst’s role\nBeing a good analyst means more than knowing the right techniques. It means understanding the business problem, evaluating the quality of the data, and making thoughtful decisions about how to present and interpret results. It’s about being honest when uncertainty is high, and being clear about what the data can and cannot tell us.\nIn short, analytics gives us leverage—but it doesn’t replace leadership. The best decisions come when rigorous analysis meets sound judgment.",

    "text": "1.7 1.6 Ethics in Business Analytics\nBusiness analytics is not just a technical activity—it is also a human one. Every decision about what data to collect, how to analyze it, and how to act on it involves ethical considerations.\n\n1.7.1 Data use raises ethical responsibilities\nAs businesses gain more powerful tools to collect and interpret data, they also take on greater responsibility. Three core ethical concerns should guide any data-driven initiative:\n\nAvoid bias.\nAlgorithms and models can reflect—and even amplify—existing biases in the data. For example, a hiring model trained on past decisions may replicate patterns of discrimination unless actively corrected. Ethical analytics involves detecting, understanding, and mitigating such bias.\nProtect privacy.\nWith more data comes more risk. Businesses must handle customer, employee, and user data with care. That means complying with legal requirements (like the GDPR or Australia’s Privacy Act), but also going beyond compliance to ask: Are we using this data in ways that our stakeholders would consider reasonable and respectful?\nPromote fairness.\nDecisions driven by analytics—such as who gets a loan, a promotion, or a targeted offer—can have real consequences. Ethical analytics means being transparent about how decisions are made and striving to ensure that outcomes are just and inclusive.\n\n\nEthical analytics isn’t just about what you can do with data—it’s about what you should do.\n\nThese issues will return in later chapters—especially when we discuss data collection, machine learning, and A/B testing. In each of those contexts, ethical decision-making is not an optional add-on, but a core part of responsible business practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Algorithmic Management and Worker Autonomy\n\n\n\nIn Southeast Asia, ride-hailing platforms like Grab have implemented algorithmic management systems to coordinate labor, match drivers with passengers, and set dynamic pricing. While these systems enhance efficiency, they have also raised concerns about transparency and fairness.\nDrivers often report a lack of clarity on how decisions are made regarding ride assignments and fare calculations, leading to feelings of disempowerment and uncertainty about their earnings. A study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace highlighted that such algorithmic management can disrupt traditional labor relations, making work more individualized and reducing opportunities for collective bargaining.\nThe opaque nature of these systems can exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly for workers in marginalized communities who may lack institutional support. This case underscores the importance of embedding ethical considerations into the design and implementation of analytics systems, ensuring that they promote fairness and transparency for all stakeholders.\nSource: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\n\n\n\n\n1.7.2 Ethics is not optional\nFirms that ignore these responsibilities may face backlash, regulatory penalties, or long-term reputational damage. But beyond risk avoidance, ethical analytics also presents a positive opportunity: to build trust, foster loyalty, and support a more responsible form of business.\nEthical thinking doesn’t happen at the end of an analysis. It must be embedded at every stage—from how we frame questions to how we communicate results. Throughout this course, we will return to this theme as we encounter specific ethical trade-offs in modeling, measurement, and experimentation.\nDone well, business analytics can help firms grow in ways that are not only efficient, but sustainable and fair. It’s up to analysts to ensure that data is used wisely—and responsibly.",

And good decisions need more than numbers. They need interpretation, judgment, and communication. This is where the business analyst comes in.\nBusiness analysts sit at the intersection of data and decision-making. They are not just technicians or model-builders—they are interpreters. Their job is to make data meaningful to the people who need to act on it.\n\n“MBAs who have good business intuition but also speak the language of statisticians are rock stars.” — Susan Athey, Professor of Economics at Stanford\n\nWhile this quote mentions MBAs, it’s not just about the degree.

That’s exactly the kind of foundation this course is designed to build.\n\n1.9.1 Analysts are modern storytellers\nHumans are natural storytellers. For thousands of years, stories have helped us make sense of complexity—turning scattered events into patterns, and patterns into meaning.\nToday’s business analysts continue this tradition. But instead of myth or anecdote, they use data. The tools may be newer, but the mission is timeless: to tell clear, truthful, and compelling stories that help others see what is happening—and decide what to do next.\nThat story might be about why sales are falling, how investor sentiment is improving, or what might happen if the firm raises prices or changes strategy. But in every case, the analyst’s role is the same: to build a bridge between the data and the decision.\n\n\n1.9.2 Core skills of the business analyst\nTo succeed in this role, analysts need a blend of skills:\n\nBusiness understanding\nYou must understand the context: What is the decision? What matters to stakeholders? What constraints shape the options?\nData analysis\nYou need to clean, explore, and model data using the right tools. This includes both descriptive and predictive methods—and increasingly, causal tools to support strategy.\nCommunication and storytelling\nYou must craft narratives that are not only statistically sound, but also understandable, relevant, and actionable.\n\nThese skills don’t develop overnight. They grow through practice—through working on real problems, engaging with real data, and reflecting on how analysis shapes action.\n\n\n1.9.3 Collaboration is essential\nBusiness analysts don’t work alone. They collaborate with data engineers, who build the infrastructure and pipelines that make analysis possible; with business stakeholders, who define the problems and act on the results; and with other analysts, who bring complementary expertise and perspectives.\nThe analyst is the glue—the person who keeps the analytical process connected to business goals, ethical standards, and practical decisions.",

    "text": "2.1.1 What Does It Mean to Think Like a Scientist?\nScience is about systematically learning from the world. Scientists don’t just collect data—they start with questions, form hypotheses, and test them. They let evidence shape their beliefs. And when new evidence emerges, they adjust their thinking accordingly.\nBusiness scientists do the same thing, just in a commercial setting.\nYou might find yourself investigating:\n\nWhy a product isn’t selling as expected\nWhether a loyalty program actually increased retention\nHow to segment your customer base more effectively\n\nIn each case, you’re not just reporting numbers. You’re solving a puzzle. You’re building a case. You’re making it easier for someone—your manager, your client, your team—to make a better decision.\n\n\n2.1.2 The Business Scientist Mindset\nHere’s how a business scientist approaches problems:\n🧠 Forming hypotheses You don’t dive into data blindly. You start by thinking: What might be driving this outcome? What would I expect to see if that explanation were true?\n📊 Testing ideas with data You treat data as evidence. Your ideas aren’t valid because you believe them—they’re supported because the evidence suggests they hold up.\n🔁 Iterating and refining You rarely get everything right on the first attempt. You explore, learn, revise, and improve. That’s not a weakness—it’s how good analytics works.\n🗣️ Communicating clearly You translate complexity into clarity. You don’t just present findings—you tell a story that helps people act on what you’ve discovered.\nThink of yourself as a business scientist—part detective, part strategist, part storyteller. Your role is to uncover patterns, test explanations, and help businesses make smarter, evidence-based decisions.\n\n\n2.1.3 Why This Matters\nCompanies today sit on mountains of data. But data alone doesn’t create value. Thinking well with data—asking good questions, finding the right evidence, drawing clear conclusions—is what transforms information into insight.\nThat’s what you’ll learn in this course: not just how to run an analysis, but how to think like a business scientist, from initial problem to actionable insight.",

    "text": "2.2 The 8 Skills of a Business Scientist\nBusiness analytics isn’t just about knowing which buttons to press. It’s about how you think.\nSome analysts focus heavily on tools—what software they can use, how many models they know. But the best business analysts succeed because of their skills. Skills help you adapt to new problems, collaborate with teams, and communicate with clarity. Tools come and go. Skills stick with you.\nSome of these skills you’ll use in every project. Others will depend on your role, your industry, or your team. What we offer here is a starting point—a map of what it means to be a business scientist.\n\n2.2.1 The Skills\nHere are 8 essential skills that make up the foundation of great business analytics:\n\n2.2.1.1 1. Understand the Business World\n🧭 Skill: Institutional Detail\nBusinesses don’t operate in a vacuum. Each one exists within a broader ecosystem—shaped by its customers, competitors, suppliers, regulations, and traditions. Great analysts take the time to understand how their organization works from the inside out.\nThis means learning about pricing structures, seasonality, logistics, marketing strategies, regulatory constraints, and competitive dynamics. It means understanding the industry’s rhythms: when do customers typically buy? What external factors drive demand? How does the sales process actually work? Without this context, it’s easy to misinterpret what the data is telling you.\nThink of this as becoming fluent in your company’s language. Every business has its own vocabulary, its own calendar of important events, and its own unwritten rules about how things get done. The more you understand these institutional details, the better you’ll be at spotting meaningful patterns in the data—and avoiding false conclusions.\n🛍️ Example: Before analyzing Starbucks sales, you’d want to understand seasonal drinks (pumpkin spice latte season), loyalty programs (how stars and rewards work), the role of store location (airport vs. neighborhood), and operational details (morning rush patterns). Without that context, even the cleanest sales data won’t help you make useful recommendations.\n\n\n2.2.1.2 2. Find the Right Data\n🔎 Skill: Data Discovery\nData discovery is the art of figuring out what information exists—and what’s actually useful. Real-world data is messy and scattered. It lives in spreadsheets, dashboards, PDFs, databases, cloud tools, and even emails. Analysts must be part detective, knowing where to look and who to ask.\nThis skill involves both technical knowledge (understanding different data formats and storage systems) and social intelligence (knowing which colleagues have access to what information). You need to map the data landscape: What gets measured? What doesn’t? Who owns which datasets? How frequently is information updated?\nJust as importantly, you must assess quality and completeness: Is this data reliable? Are there systematic gaps? Does it actually capture what we care about? Sometimes the data you want doesn’t exist—and you need to figure out how to create it or find reasonable proxies.\n👗 Example: To help a fashion brand identify trending products, you might combine sales figures from the point-of-sale system, customer reviews from the website, social media mentions from marketing tools, and return data from customer service. Each source adds a piece to the puzzle, but you need to know where each piece lives and how to access it.\n\n\n2.2.1.3 3. Understand People and Firms\n💡 Skill: Business Theory\nBehind every data point is a human decision. Understanding what motivates people—whether they’re customers, employees, or executives—is crucial for meaningful analysis. Business theory gives you the frameworks to make sense of behavior: pricing strategy, supply and demand, consumer psychology, organizational incentives, and market dynamics.\nThis isn’t about memorizing textbook theories—it’s about having mental models that help you interpret patterns. Why might sales spike on certain days? What drives customer loyalty? How do competitors respond to new products? Theory helps you move from what happened to why it happened—and more importantly, what might happen next.\nGood business analysts think like economists and psychologists. They understand that people respond to incentives, that markets have predictable patterns, and that organizational structures shape behavior in systematic ways.\n📱 Example: If a telecom company offers holiday discounts, do sales rise because of the discount itself—or because people were planning to upgrade their phones anyway during the holiday season? Understanding consumer behavior theory (timing of purchases, price sensitivity, seasonal patterns) helps you think beyond the surface correlation.\n\n\n2.2.1.4 4. Choose the Right Tool\n🛠️ Skill: Analytical Models\nDifferent questions require different methods. Sometimes a simple average is all you need. Other times, the problem calls for predictive algorithms, statistical modeling, or machine learning techniques. Good analysts know how to match the complexity of the tool to the complexity of the task.\nThis skill involves understanding the assumptions behind different analytical approaches. When is a correlation meaningful? When do you need a more sophisticated causal inference method? How do you balance model complexity with interpretability? The goal isn’t to use the fanciest method available—it’s to use the right method for the question at hand.\nGreat analysts also know when not to model. Sometimes the answer is sitting right there in a simple table or chart. Sometimes you need to gather more data before any analysis makes sense. Knowing when to keep it simple—and when a more sophisticated method will yield deeper insights—is a crucial judgment call.\n🌦️ Example: Predicting tomorrow’s weather and recommending a new Netflix show both require data analysis—but they need very different approaches. Weather prediction relies on physical models and time series analysis. Content recommendation depends on collaborative filtering and preference learning. The underlying data science principles overlap, but the specific tools are quite different.\n\n\n2.2.1.5 5. Know What Can Go Wrong\n⚠️ Skill: Analytical Theory\nData is powerful, but it can also mislead. Bad analysis leads to bad decisions—sometimes expensive ones. Analysts must be skeptical and methodical, aware of potential pitfalls like selection bias, confounding variables, data leakage, overfitting, and missing information.\nThis skill is about developing what statisticians call “statistical thinking”—the ability to reason about uncertainty, causation, and the limitations of your analysis. It means asking hard questions: Could this correlation be spurious? Are we measuring what we think we’re measuring? What assumptions are we making, and how would our conclusions change if those assumptions were wrong?\nThe best analysts are constructively paranoid. They stress-test their findings, look for alternative explanations, and clearly communicate the boundaries of what their analysis can and cannot tell you. This isn’t about being negative—it’s about being honest about what the evidence actually supports.\n🛒 Example: If weekend sales are missing from an online store’s records, your analysis might suggest that no one shops on Saturdays and Sundays. But that’s a data quality issue, not a customer behavior pattern. Learning to spot these kinds of problems—and knowing how to investigate them—prevents you from drawing false conclusions.\n\n\n2.2.1.6 6. Work with Code and Technology\n💻 Skill: Computational Skills\nToday’s business analysts work with code. Languages like R, Python, or SQL let you clean data, test models, automate analyses, and produce reproducible results. Knowing how to code makes your work faster, more transparent, and easier to scale. It also makes you more independent—you’re not waiting for someone else to pull the data or run the analysis.\nBut this isn’t about becoming a software engineer. It’s about being comfortable enough with technology to solve data problems efficiently. You need to understand how to import data, manipulate it, create visualizations, and document your work so others can follow your logic.\nModern analytics also involves working with various platforms: databases, cloud services, business intelligence tools, and collaboration software. The specific technologies change, but the underlying computational thinking—breaking problems into steps, debugging when things go wrong, automating repetitive tasks—remains constant.\n🍳 Example: Learning R or Python is like learning to cook. At first, you follow recipes exactly (copying code from tutorials). Gradually, you understand the ingredients and techniques well enough to start experimenting and adapting recipes to your own needs.\n\n\n2.2.1.7 7. Communicate What You Find\n📊 Skill: Presentation & Communication\nGreat insights don’t speak for themselves. You need to help them speak to others. Whether it’s through a visualization, a dashboard, or a brief presentation, good analysts craft narratives that make results clear and actionable. This means understanding your audience and choosing the right level of detail to tell the story your data wants to tell.\nCommunication in analytics is both an art and a science. You need to understand principles of visual design (what makes charts clear vs. confusing), storytelling (how to structure findings for maximum impact), and persuasion (how to connect insights to business decisions). Different audiences need different approaches: executives want high-level implications, while your analyst colleagues might want methodological details.\nThe goal isn’t just to report what you found—it’s to change how people think or act. That requires understanding not just the data, but the people who will use your analysis to make decisions.\n📈 Example: Rather than saying “Sales rose 15% in Q3,” you might create a simple line graph that highlights exactly when sales jumped after a new marketing campaign launched. The visual makes the timing clear, and the context helps viewers understand what drove the change.\n\n\n2.2.1.8 8. Ask the Right Questions\n🎯 Skill: Creativity & Judgment\nBusiness analytics starts with curiosity. Before you can run any analysis, you need a question worth answering. This skill is about identifying problems, noticing patterns, and reframing vague business goals into focused, answerable questions.\nThis requires both creativity (seeing problems from new angles) and business judgment (knowing what matters to the organization). It means distinguishing between questions that are interesting and questions that are actionable. It also means knowing when to dig deeper into an unexpected finding and when to move on.\nThe best analysts are natural investigators. They notice when something doesn’t make sense, they wonder about cause-and-effect relationships, and they’re always asking “what if?” This curiosity, combined with strong business judgment, helps them identify the questions that will have the biggest impact on decisions.\n👟 Example: Don’t just ask, “How many shoes did we sell?” Ask, “What time of day do we sell the most shoes—and why might that pattern exist?” The second question opens up possibilities for better staffing, targeted promotions, and deeper customer insights.\n\n\n10 min\n\n\n📝 Check-In: Which Skills Do You Already Have?\nTake a moment to reflect. Which of the 8 skills below do you feel most confident in? Which ones do you want to develop this semester?\n\n\n\nSkill\nConfidence Level (1 = low, 5 = high)\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the business world\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\nFinding the right data\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\nUnderstanding how people and firms work\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\nChoosing the right model or tool\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\nKnowing what can go wrong\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\nCoding and working with data tools\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\nCommunicating insights\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\nAsking good questions\n☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5\n\n\n\nReflection questions: - Which skill are you most excited to build? - Which skill do you think businesses value most?

    "section": "2.3 Applying and Combining the Skills",
    "text": "2.3 Applying and Combining the Skills\nNot every project calls for every skill. Some are universal—you’ll use them no matter what kind of data you’re working with. Others depend on your specific role, the nature of the business, or the kind of question you’re trying to answer.\nUnderstanding this distinction helps you prioritize your development and recognize what makes different analytics roles unique. It also explains why some analysts gravitate toward certain types of projects—their skill sets naturally align with particular kinds of business problems.\n\n2.3.1 Universal Skills: Always Needed\nSome skills form the foundation of good analytics practice. They show up in nearly every project and across all industries. Think of these as the core competencies that every business scientist needs, regardless of their specific role or the complexity of their technical toolkit.\nUnderstand the Business World is perhaps the most universal skill of all. No analysis happens in a vacuum. Whether you’re working on a simple sales report or building a complex predictive model, you need to understand the business context to interpret patterns and generate useful insights. Without this foundation, even the most sophisticated analysis can lead to irrelevant or misleading conclusions.\nFind the Right Data is equally essential. Good decisions require good inputs. Whether you’re scraping websites, querying databases, conducting surveys, or pulling data from APIs, this skill shows up in every project. It’s not just about technical data extraction—it’s about knowing what information you need and where to find it.\nCommunicate What You Find is the bridge between analysis and action. You must always be able to translate your findings into clear, compelling narratives that help people make better decisions. This skill determines whether your insights actually get used or just sit in a report somewhere.\nAsk the Right Questions drives everything else. Even in highly structured environments, the ability to think beyond the obvious and identify questions worth answering is what separates good analysts from great ones. Every project starts with curiosity and judgment about what’s worth investigating.\n\n\n2.3.2 Role- or Project-Specific Skills: Context-Dependent\nThe remaining skills become more or less important depending on your role, industry, or the specific challenges you’re trying to solve. This is where specialization begins to matter.\nUnderstand People and Firms becomes particularly crucial in strategic roles, consulting positions, or customer insights work where understanding incentives and behavior is key. If you’re trying to explain why customers churn, how employees respond to new policies, or how competitors might react to your pricing strategy, this skill moves from helpful to essential.\nChoose the Right Tool is vital in roles that involve predictive modeling, optimization, or simulation—such as pricing analysts, demand forecasters, risk managers, or algorithm designers. If your job involves building models that directly drive business decisions, you need deep expertise in matching analytical methods to business problems.\nKnow What Can Go Wrong becomes especially important in high-stakes or regulated industries like finance, healthcare, insurance, or pharmaceuticals, where analytical errors can have serious consequences. When precision is critical and the cost of being wrong is high, this skill moves from good practice to professional requirement.\nWork with Code and Technology varies dramatically by role. It’s vital for data engineers, machine learning practitioners, and analysts working with large or complex data pipelines. But it’s less essential if your role emphasizes interpretation over data transformation, or if you work primarily with pre-built dashboards and business intelligence tools.\n\n\n2.3.3 How Skills Combine in Practice\nThe real power comes from combining these skills thoughtfully. A customer insights analyst might lean heavily on business theory and communication skills while using relatively simple analytical methods. A pricing analyst might focus on advanced modeling techniques while working closely with economists to understand market dynamics. A data engineer might prioritize computational skills and analytical theory to build reliable data pipelines.\nConsider how different roles emphasize different skill combinations:\nStrategic Analyst: Strong in business understanding, communication, and asking good questions. May use simpler analytical methods but applies them to high-impact business problems.\nQuantitative Analyst: Deep expertise in analytical models and theory, with strong computational skills. Focuses on building sophisticated analyses that inform specific decisions.\nCustomer Insights Specialist: Combines business theory (understanding consumer behavior) with strong communication skills and creative questioning to uncover actionable insights about customers.\nOperations Analyst: Balances institutional knowledge, data discovery, and practical modeling to optimize day-to-day business processes.\n\n\n2.3.4 Key Takeaway\nWhile every business scientist needs a broad foundation across all eight skills, your role and interests will naturally shape which ones you develop most deeply. One size doesn’t fit all—but every project needs strong fundamentals.\nAs you progress in your career, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward certain types of problems that align with your strongest skills. That’s not just natural—it’s strategic. The best analysts understand their own capabilities and seek out projects where they can have the greatest impact.\nThe goal isn’t to be equally strong in everything. It’s to be strong enough in the fundamentals to be effective anywhere, while developing specialized expertise in the areas that matter most for the work you want to do.\n\n\n2.3.5 Mini Case: Different Roles, Same Goal\nThe Challenge: Streamly, a fast-scaling global music streaming service, has recently expanded into over a dozen countries across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. But something’s wrong—churn rates in some regions are much higher than expected. The executive team wants to know why users are leaving—and what can be done to retain them.\nThree different analysts are brought in to investigate. Each brings a different background, focus, and skill mix. Their conclusions differ—but each adds a crucial piece of the puzzle:\n🤖 The Data Scientist works with millions of user-level records. They apply survival models and gradient boosting techniques to identify leading indicators of churn. Their models show that users who fail to engage with playlists or explore new genres in their first 10 days are at significantly higher risk of cancellation. The recommendation: surface discovery tools earlier in the onboarding journey and refine personalization algorithms.\nKey skills: Choose the Right Tool + Work with Code and Technology + Know What Can Go Wrong\n📊 The Market Research Analyst leads cross-country qualitative research. Their interviews and survey analyses show that cultural preferences vary widely. In some markets, users feel disconnected from the platform due to a lack of regional artists and limited live concert integrations. The recommendation: develop localized content strategies with stronger regional editorial teams.\nKey skills: Understand People and Firms + Find the Right Data + Understand the Business World\n🎯 The Business Strategist takes a market-level approach. They benchmark pricing, bundling, and partnerships across countries and competitors. Their analysis reveals that in high-churn markets, local competitors offer more flexible subscription tiers, including family and student discounts. Their insight: product-market fit isn’t just about content or algorithms—it’s also about pricing and access. The recommendation: adapt the business model to match local price expectations.\nKey skills: Understand the Business World + Ask the Right Questions + Understand People and Firms\nThe Plot Twist: Each analyst presents to the executive team. Rather than choose one solution, leadership realizes that each perspective highlights a different root cause. Improving retention requires addressing personalization, content strategy, and pricing together. The company launches a cross-functional retention initiative.\n💬 Questions for Reflection:\n\nWhat kind of analyst would you most want to be in this situation? Why?\nIf you were leading the project, how would you decide which recommendation to prioritize first?\nAre there any skills missing from this team that could make the solution even stronger?\nHow might cultural differences, platform design, or competitive strategy interact in ways that none of the analysts saw on their own?\n\n🎯 The Lesson: Different skill combinations reveal different dimensions of the same problem. True impact often comes from integrating insights across roles. Business scientists don’t just answer questions—they collaborate to shape better ones.\n\n\n2.3.6 Choosing the Right Skill Mix for a Project\nWhile every business scientist needs a broad foundation across all eight skills, your role and interests will naturally shape which ones you develop most deeply. One size doesn’t fit all—but every project needs strong fundamentals.\nAs you progress in your career, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward certain types of problems that align with your strongest skills. That’s not just natural—it’s strategic. The best analysts understand their own capabilities and seek out projects where they can have the greatest impact.\nThe goal isn’t to be equally strong in everything. It’s to be strong enough in the fundamentals to be effective anywhere, while developing specialized expertise in the areas that matter most for the work you want to do.\n\n2.3.6.1 Building a Versatile Skill Set\nDeveloping as a business scientist is a marathon, not a sprint. The eight skills we’ve outlined provide a roadmap, but how do you decide where to focus your energy? And how do you build expertise systematically rather than haphazardly?\nHow to Identify Which Skills to Develop\nStart with honest self-assessment. Look back at projects you’ve worked on—whether in school, internships, or previous jobs. Which parts felt natural? Which felt like a struggle? This isn’t about being hard on yourself; it’s about understanding your current capabilities so you can build strategically.\nTry this exercise: For each of the eight skills, think of a specific example where you used it successfully, and another where you wished you were stronger. Maybe you’re great at spotting patterns in data but struggle to explain them clearly to non-technical audiences. Or perhaps you excel at understanding business context but feel lost when choosing between different analytical approaches.\nNext, consider your career aspirations. What roles genuinely interest you? Look beyond job titles to understand what these positions actually require day-to-day. A “data scientist” at a startup might spend most of their time on data discovery and communication, while the same title at a tech giant might emphasize advanced modeling and computational skills.\nResearch real job postings, talk to professionals in roles you find interesting, and pay attention to which skills come up repeatedly. Don’t just focus on the technical requirements—notice how often communication, business understanding, and judgment appear in job descriptions, even for highly technical roles.\nDeveloping Skills Over Time\nThe temptation is to jump straight into the most exciting or advanced skills. But expertise builds on itself. Master the fundamentals before specializing.\nStart with the universal skills that appear in every project: understanding business context, finding good data, communicating clearly, and asking smart questions. These form the foundation that makes everything else more effective. You can’t build sophisticated models if you don’t understand the business problem you’re trying to solve. You can’t have impact if you can’t explain your findings clearly.\nOnce you’re solid on the fundamentals, identify one or two specialization areas that align with your interests and career goals. If you’re drawn to strategic roles, deepen your understanding of business theory and market dynamics. If you love the technical challenge of modeling, focus on expanding your analytical toolkit and learning to spot potential pitfalls.\nHere’s how to approach skill development practically:\nThrough Projects: The best learning happens when you’re trying to solve real problems. Seek out opportunities to work on projects that stretch your capabilities. Volunteer for analyses that require skills you want to develop. Take on side projects that let you experiment with new tools or techniques.\nThrough Courses: Formal learning provides structure and depth. But choose courses strategically. If you’re weak on fundamentals, prioritize business courses, statistics, and communication training over advanced machine learning. If you’re strong on basics, dive deeper into specialized areas.\nThrough Collaboration: Work with people whose skills complement yours. Partner with someone who’s strong where you’re weak. Watch how experienced analysts approach problems. Ask questions about their process, not just their conclusions.\nThrough Reflection: After each project, spend time thinking about what went well and what didn’t. Which skills made the biggest difference? Where did you get stuck? What would you do differently next time? This reflection turns experience into expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA Practical Development Strategy\nYear 1: Focus on universal skills. Get comfortable with data discovery, basic analysis, and clear communication. Work on understanding business context in whatever industry you’re in.\nYear 2-3: Add depth in 1-2 specialized areas. Choose based on your interests and the opportunities you see. If you love understanding customer behavior, deepen your knowledge of business theory and psychology. If you’re drawn to technical challenges, expand your modeling skills.\nYear 4+: Develop leadership and strategic thinking. Learn to frame problems, not just solve them. Practice helping others develop their analytical skills. Start thinking about how analytics can drive business strategy.\n\n\nRemember: skill development never stops. Technology changes, industries evolve, and new analytical methods emerge. The goal isn’t to master everything once—it’s to build a foundation that lets you adapt and grow throughout your career.\nThe best business scientists are curious, self-aware, and strategic about their development. They know their strengths, understand their gaps, and actively work to expand their capabilities. Most importantly, they never stop learning.\nBusiness problems are messy. They don’t come with a checklist of which skill to use. That’s why adaptability is so important. The best business scientists can shift between perspectives, combine tools, and reframe questions depending on the context.\nIn this course, we won’t just teach you specific techniques—we’ll help you build a flexible mindset and a workflow that you can mix and remix as projects evolve. That’s what makes analytics not just powerful—but fun.\nThe best business scientists don’t just have strong individual skills—they know how to combine those skills systematically to solve complex problems. That’s where the business analytics workflow comes in.",

    "text": "2.4 The Business Analytics Workflow\nA structured approach to solving business problems with data.\nNow that you’ve seen how different skill combinations shape the way analysts think and work, it’s time to put those skills into action. The workflow we’re about to explore offers a structured—but adaptable—way to move from a vague business problem to a clear, evidence-based recommendation. It helps ensure you approach problems with the same mindset as a business scientist: curious, critical, and creative.\nThink of this workflow as your analytical GPS. Just like navigation software, it provides a reliable route while allowing for detours when you discover something unexpected. The workflow doesn’t follow a strict linear order—you might go back and forth between steps as your understanding deepens. That’s not a flaw, it’s part of what makes this process powerful.\nMore importantly, each step in the workflow draws on the skills you’ve been learning about. You’ll see how “Ask the Right Questions” drives the first step, how “Find the Right Data” and “Work with Code and Technology” power the middle steps, and how “Communicate What You Find” brings everything together at the end.\nBelow, we walk through each stage:\n\n2.4.1 1. Define the Business Question and Plan Outputs\nEvery good analysis starts with a clear question. What are we trying to understand, predict, or change? Defining the business question forces clarity about what matters. Just as important is imagining what the final output might look like—a chart, a dashboard, a decision. By sketching the destination, we can plan a smarter route to get there.\nWe also ask: what does success look like? Who is this analysis for? What would make it useful? This step is where your ability to Ask the Right Questions and Understand the Business World becomes crucial.\n\n\n2.4.2 2. Acquire and Prepare the Data\nOnce we know what we’re looking for, we gather the data that might help us find it. This step includes locating sources, cleaning messy files, checking for missing values, and creating new variables that capture meaningful patterns. Preparing data well isn’t glamorous—but it’s where most of the hard work happens. And doing it right sets everything else up for success.\nHere’s where Find the Right Data and Work with Code and Technology take center stage.\n\n\n2.4.3 3. Explore and Visualize Patterns\nBefore jumping into advanced methods, we take time to understand the data through visualization and summary statistics. What do distributions look like? Are there surprising trends or outliers? Do any relationships jump out? This stage is about seeing what the data wants to tell us—and starting to form hypotheses we might want to test more formally.\nThis exploratory phase draws on multiple skills: Ask the Right Questions (what patterns might exist?), Understand People and Firms (do these patterns make business sense?), and Know What Can Go Wrong (are we seeing real patterns or just noise?).\n\n\n2.4.4 4. Analyze and Interpret Findings\nWith a clearer view of the patterns, we bring in formal analytical tools. This might mean running regressions, building prediction models, or estimating causal effects. But analysis doesn’t end with numbers. We need to interpret those numbers in business terms. What do they mean for the question we started with? Do they hold up under scrutiny? Have we validated the results and checked our assumptions?\nThis is where Choose the Right Tool and Know What Can Go Wrong become essential, supported by your understanding of the business context.\n\n\n2.4.5 5. Communicate Insights and Recommendations\nFinally, we present our findings. Not just the numbers—but the story they tell. This includes choosing clear visuals, tailoring the message to our audience, and offering concrete recommendations. A good presentation doesn’t just report—it persuades. It helps others act.\nThe culmination of everything: Communicate What You Find backed by all the analytical rigor that came before.\nTogether, these five steps form a flexible but disciplined approach to solving problems with data. You’ll return to this workflow throughout the course—and throughout your career. Each time you use it, you’ll get better at knowing which skills to emphasize at which stages, and how to adapt the process to different types of business challenges.",

    "section": "2.5 Developing an Analytics Mindset",
    "text": "2.5 Developing an Analytics Mindset\nLearning tools and techniques is important, but it’s not enough. Successful business analysts share more than just technical skills—they share a way of thinking. This analytics mindset blends curiosity, skepticism, and patience to uncover insights that others might miss.\nThink of it this way: anyone can learn to use Excel or run a regression. But knowing when to dig deeper, how to spot potential problems, and why to question seemingly obvious results—that’s what separates good analysts from great ones.\n\n2.5.1 Why Curiosity and Skepticism Matter\nCuriosity is what drives you to look beyond the surface. Good analysts don’t simply accept results at face value. They dig deeper, challenge assumptions, and ask “why?” repeatedly. When sales dropped in Q3, they don’t just report the number—they wonder what might have caused it. When a marketing campaign shows positive results, they ask whether the success would hold up in different conditions.\nThis curiosity drives analysts to explore alternative explanations and uncover hidden patterns. Maybe the sales drop coincided with a competitor’s promotion. Maybe the marketing success was driven by one demographic that won’t respond the same way next time. Curious analysts keep digging until they understand not just what happened, but why it happened.\nSkepticism keeps analysts grounded. Business decisions are often made based on incomplete, noisy, or imperfect data. Accepting findings without question can lead to costly mistakes. A healthy dose of skepticism means you test, validate, and verify your results before drawing conclusions.\nThis doesn’t mean being negative or cynical. It means being constructively critical. When you see a surprising result, you ask: Could this be a data error? Are we measuring what we think we’re measuring? What assumptions are we making, and how would our conclusions change if those assumptions were wrong?\nThe best analysts are simultaneously optimistic about what data can reveal and realistic about its limitations. They trust the process while questioning the results.\n\n\n2.5.2 The Importance of Iteration and Refining Insights\nRarely does the first analysis give the perfect answer. The analytics process is more like a journey of discovery than a one-time calculation. Each step reveals new information that shapes the next step.\nAs you gather data and analyze results, new questions naturally emerge. You might find surprises that challenge your initial ideas or discover better ways to frame the original problem. Maybe you started investigating customer churn but realized you first need to understand what “active customer” means in your business. Maybe you set out to optimize pricing but discovered that the real issue is product positioning.\nThis is why iteration is essential. It means revisiting your assumptions, trying different analytical approaches, and improving your analysis step-by-step. Each cycle of exploration, analysis, and reflection leads to deeper understanding.\nIteration might look like:\n\nStarting with simple descriptive statistics, then moving to more sophisticated models\nTesting your findings on different time periods or customer segments\nApproaching the same question from multiple analytical angles\nRefining your data sources as you learn what information matters most\nAdjusting your business question as you understand the problem better\n\nThis iterative approach requires patience. In a world that wants answers immediately, good analysts know that rushing to conclusions often means missing the most important insights. They’re comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty—not because they like being confused, but because they know that sitting with complexity often leads to breakthrough understanding.\n\n\n2.5.3 Building Your Analytics Mindset\nDeveloping this mindset isn’t something that happens overnight—it takes practice and persistence. But you can start building these thinking patterns right away:\nPractice asking “why” three times in a row. When you see any business result or data pattern, push yourself to go deeper. Why did this happen? Why might that be the case? Why does that matter?\nLook for alternative explanations. Whenever you have a hypothesis about what’s driving a pattern, force yourself to come up with at least two other possible explanations. This trains you to think more broadly about causation.\nEmbrace being wrong. Some of your initial hypotheses will be incorrect. That’s not failure—it’s learning. The faster you discover what doesn’t work, the faster you get to what does.\nQuestion your own methods. After every analysis, ask yourself: What could I have done differently? What assumptions did I make? What would I want to test next time?\nBy embracing curiosity, skepticism, and iteration, you’ll build a powerful way of thinking that will serve you well throughout your career. This mindset, combined with strong technical skills, is what transforms data workers into true business scientists.",

    "section": "2.6 Analytics in the Age of Generative AI",
    "text": "2.6 Analytics in the Age of Generative AI\nWe’re living through a remarkable moment in business analytics. Artificial intelligence can now write code, generate reports, create visualizations, and even propose business recommendations. For many students, this raises an uncomfortable question: if AI can do analytics, why do we need human analysts?\nThe answer lies in understanding what AI can and cannot do—and why the analytics mindset we’ve been discussing becomes even more important, not less, in an AI-powered world.\n\n2.6.1 AI and the Analytics Mindset: Why Human Judgment Still Matters\nArtificial Intelligence has transformed many parts of business analytics. It can quickly generate reports, spot patterns in vast datasets, and even suggest potential solutions. Modern AI tools can write SQL queries, create charts, and summarize findings faster than any human analyst. But here’s what AI fundamentally cannot do: it doesn’t truly understand the business context or what matters most to decision-makers.\nThink of it this way: imagine you take a photo of an important artwork at a museum and ask an AI to explain it to your grandmother. The AI might describe colors, shapes, and objects in the image with impressive detail. It could even tell you about the painting technique or the historical period. But it won’t know why the artwork moves you, what personal story it tells, or why it’s meaningful in your family’s history.\nIn the same way, AI can generate analytical insights—but it doesn’t grasp the nuance behind those insights or the human meaning they carry. It might correctly identify that customer satisfaction scores dropped in the Southeast region, but it won’t know that your company just went through a difficult regional restructuring, or that this drop might actually represent progress compared to where things were six months ago.\nThis is why human judgment remains not just important, but essential. Analysts play the critical role of interpreting AI-generated findings within business context. They decide which pieces of information are actually relevant, apply their understanding of organizational dynamics, and shape raw insights into actionable recommendations that account for political realities, resource constraints, and strategic priorities.\nWithout this human touch, AI’s outputs risk becoming sophisticated noise rather than actionable clarity.\n\n\n2.6.2 AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement\nIt’s tempting to think of AI as a magic solution that can solve any analytical problem. But relying entirely on AI without human guidance is like giving someone a powerful sports car without teaching them to drive. The car has incredible capability, but without a skilled driver who understands traffic patterns, road conditions, and the destination, that power becomes dangerous rather than helpful.\nIn business analytics, AI is best understood as a powerful amplifier of human capability rather than a replacement for it. Here’s how the relationship works in practice:\nAI excels at: Processing large volumes of data quickly, identifying statistical patterns, generating multiple analytical approaches, creating visualizations, and automating routine calculations.\nHumans excel at: Understanding business context, asking the right questions, interpreting results within organizational constraints, spotting when something “doesn’t smell right,” and translating insights into decisions that account for human factors.\nThe most effective analysts use AI to handle the computational heavy lifting while they focus on the strategic thinking. They might use AI to generate an initial analysis, then apply their business knowledge to determine which findings matter most. They might ask AI to create several different visualizations, then choose the ones that best tell the story their audience needs to hear.\nCritically, skilled analysts also serve as quality control for AI outputs. They test AI-generated analyses for logical consistency, check for potential biases in the data or methods, and validate results against their understanding of how the business actually works.\n\n\n2.6.3 What This Means for Your Development\nRather than making analytical skills less important, AI makes certain aspects of the analytics mindset even more crucial:\nAsking the Right Questions becomes more important because AI can quickly generate answers to any question you pose—but it can’t determine which questions are worth asking in the first place.\nUnderstanding the Business World becomes more valuable because AI lacks the contextual knowledge to interpret its own outputs meaningfully.\nKnowing What Can Go Wrong becomes essential because AI can confidently present incorrect or misleading results, and someone needs to catch those errors before they influence business decisions.\nCommunicating What You Find remains uniquely human because AI can’t read the room, understand organizational politics, or tailor messages for specific stakeholders’ concerns and motivations.\n\n\n2.6.4 Looking Forward: The AI-Augmented Analyst\nThe future belongs to analysts who understand AI’s strengths and limitations, who use AI tools to enhance their work, and who keep the human perspective front and center in decision-making.\nThese analysts don’t fear AI—they leverage it. They use AI to explore more possibilities faster, to test more hypotheses, and to free up time for the high-value work of interpretation, strategy, and decision support that only humans can provide.\nThey also understand that as AI handles more of the routine analytical work, the bar for human analysts gets higher, not lower. The analysts who thrive will be those who can think strategically, communicate clearly, and bridge the gap between AI’s computational power and business leaders’ need for wisdom.\nThe goal isn’t to compete with AI—it’s to dance with it. And that dance requires exactly the kind of analytical mindset we’ve been building: curious, skeptical, iterative, and deeply grounded in business understanding.",

    "text": "2.7 What’s Next?\nYou now have the foundation every business scientist needs: a clear understanding of the eight core skills, a structured workflow for approaching problems, and the analytical mindset that separates good analysts from great ones. More importantly, you understand that business analytics isn’t just about technical tools—it’s about thinking clearly and asking smart questions in service of better decisions.\nBut understanding the framework is just the beginning. The real learning happens when you start getting your hands dirty with actual data.\n\n2.7.1 From Theory to Practice\nIn the chapters ahead, you’ll stop reading about analytics and start doing it. You’ll work with real datasets from companies across different industries—from subscription services tracking customer behavior to retailers analyzing sales patterns to tech startups optimizing their user experience.\nEach project will give you the chance to practice different aspects of the workflow:\n\nYou’ll wrestle with messy, incomplete data and learn how to clean it systematically\nYou’ll explore datasets to uncover unexpected patterns and form hypotheses about what’s driving them\n\nYou’ll choose analytical methods that match your questions and learn when simple approaches work better than complex ones\nYou’ll create visualizations that actually communicate insights rather than just displaying numbers\nYou’ll present findings to different audiences and discover how the same analysis can be framed in multiple ways\n\n\n\n2.7.2 Building Your Analytical Intuition\nReading about the analytics mindset is one thing; developing it is another. As you work through upcoming projects, you’ll start to build the intuition that experienced analysts rely on—that sense of when something doesn’t look right, when to dig deeper, and when you’ve found something worth acting on.\nYou’ll make mistakes. Your first attempts at data cleaning will probably miss important issues. Your initial hypotheses will sometimes be completely wrong. You’ll create charts that confuse rather than clarify. That’s not just normal—it’s necessary. Each mistake teaches you something that no textbook can.\nYou’ll also experience those breakthrough moments when everything clicks—when a pattern emerges from seemingly random data, when you finally understand what’s driving a business problem, or when you present an insight that genuinely changes how someone thinks about their business. Those moments are what make all the technical learning worthwhile.\n\n\n2.7.3 The Journey Ahead\nOver the course ahead, you’ll progress from working with pre-cleaned datasets to sourcing and preparing your own data. You’ll move from following step-by-step instructions to designing your own analytical approaches. You’ll evolve from describing what happened to predicting what might happen next.\nBut most importantly, you’ll develop confidence in your ability to approach any business problem analytically. You’ll learn to trust the process while maintaining healthy skepticism about the results. You’ll discover that the most powerful analytical tool isn’t software—it’s a curious, disciplined way of thinking.\nBy the end of this course, you won’t just know how to use analytical tools. You’ll think like a business scientist. And in a world overflowing with data but starving for insight, that way of thinking will serve you—and the organizations you work with—for years to come.\nReady to get started?

    "text": "7.1 The Business Challenge\nOnline marketplaces like eBay host millions of auctions each year, connecting buyers and sellers across countless product categories. Behind the scenes, this generates complex, nested, and high-volume data. For a business analyst, turning this raw data into useful insights—and storing it in a way that’s efficient, accessible, and reusable—is a foundational challenge.\nYou’ve just joined the data team at a fast-growing online marketplace. Right now, every team — from marketing to data engineering and customer support — is handling auction data in different ways: some use Excel sheets, others parse logs from an API that stores information in a format called JSON, and a few engineers keep things in a different format known as Parquet (but no one else knows how to read them!).\nThis chaos is slowing everyone down. Your first task as a new analyst is to propose a better data storage solution that balances usability, scalability, and efficiency for teams across the business.\nBut how do you choose the right format? Should you push everyone to use Excel spreadsheets? Convince IT to move everything into a database? Or are columnar formats like Parquet worth the learning curve?\nBefore you decide, you’ll need to understand the strengths and trade-offs of each major data storage format. That is what we will cover in this lecture",

    "text": "7.2 Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets & Friends)\nFor many of us, spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets are the default way we have worked with data until now. They’re widely used in business and education, and offer an approachable interface for organizing tables, applying formulas, and making quick charts. This makes spreadsheets a great entry point into the world of data—but also a format with serious limitations when it comes to analytics at scale.\nSpreadsheets don’t record your steps, meaning you can’t always retrace how a figure was calculated. There’s no built-in version history (at least not one that’s easy to audit), and formulas often vary invisibly from cell to cell—especially if you’ve copied or dragged them across a range. This makes it difficult to ensure consistency and nearly impossible to reproduce or validate your results.\nEven small errors—like accidentally referencing the wrong column—can go unnoticed. A single cell with a broken formula can distort an entire analysis. These issues are especially problematic when figures or charts are being used for decisions or presentations.\nTo make matters worse, analysts often inherit spreadsheets from others—colleagues, clients, or external partners. These files might contain:\n\ninconsistent naming conventions\nmanual totals\nhidden formatting or comments\nmerged cells\nduplicated values across tabs\n\nDespite these flaws, spreadsheets remain a powerful tool for quick exploration and lightweight collaboration. They’re useful for small teams, early prototyping, or downloading data from platforms like Shopify, Facebook Ads, or Google Analytics. But when your work moves toward reproducibility, scalability, or automation, it’s time to adopt formats designed for analysis.\n\n7.2.1 Reading Spreadsheets in R\nTo load spreadsheet data into R, we use the readxl package, which allows us to read .xlsx files directly without requiring Excel to be installed.\nHere’s a simple example:\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n# Read a spreadsheet file\nauctions_excel &lt;- read_excel(\"data/ebay_auctions.xlsx\")\n\n# Peek at the first few rows\nhead(auctions_excel)\nYou can also specify a sheet name or index:\n# Read a specific sheet\nread_excel(\"data/ebay_auctions.xlsx\", sheet = \"bids\")\n\n# Or use sheet number\nread_excel(\"data/ebay_auctions.xlsx\", sheet = 2)\nBy default, read_excel() will guess the column types from the first 1000 rows.",

    "text": "7.3 Flat Files (CSV, TSV and other delimited files)\nwhen it comes to storing and sharing structured data reliably, especially in a way that can be reproduced by code, an alternative format often works better: flat files.\nFlat files look similar to spreadsheets on the surface—just rows and columns of data—but under the hood they behave very differently.\nA flat file is stored as plain text. Each line represents a row of data, and the values are separated by a special character like a comma or tab. There are no formulas, no styling, no hidden cells—just the raw information.\nOne of the most common flat file types is the CSV, which stands for Comma-Separated Values. You might have encountered files with a .csv extension when exporting data from online dashboards or business tools.\nHere’s what a CSV might look like when opened in a text editor:\nitem_id,bidder_id,amount,time\na001,u07,45.00,2023-08-21 10:13\na001,u12,47.50,2023-08-21 10:30\nThis format is:\n\nEasy to inspect and edit\nSupported by nearly every tool\nA common default for data exports\n\n\n7.3.1 Reading Flat Files in R\nIn R, we can use the readr package to import flat files quickly and reliably:\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Read a CSV file into a tibble\nauctions_flat &lt;- read_csv(\"data/bids_flat.csv\")\nThis loads your flat file into a tidy tibble for further analysis. You can also read tab-separated files (read_tsv()) or files with other delimiters (read_delim()).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDelimiters and File Extensions The character that separates columns in a flat file is called a delimiter. Common ones include:\n\nComma (,) — for .csv files\nTab ( — for .tsv files\nPipe (|) — occasionally used for exports from databases\n\nAlso note that not all .csv files use commas! Always double-check if your data loads incorrectly. You can adjust the delimiter using the delim argument in read_csv()\n\n\n\n\n5 min\n\nExercise: One Auction, Many Rows\nLet’s investigate how data is stored in a flat file format by looking at all the bids placed on a single auction.\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Step 1: Filter to a single auction with multiple bids\na1_bids &lt;- auctions_flat %&gt;%\n  filter(item_id == \"a001\")\n\n# Step 2: View the result\na1_bids\n\nHow many rows are returned? What does each row represent?\nLook at the title, category, and seller_id columns — what do you notice?\nWhat are some potential challenges that could arise from this repetition, especially as the dataset grows or changes over time?\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Why are the same values repeated?\nWhen you look at the bids for one auction, you might notice that the item title, category, and seller name appear again and again in every row. That might seem strange—why repeat the same information?\nThis happens because of the way flat files are designed. In a flat file, each row represents one observation—in this case, one bid. That means every row needs to include not just the bid amount and time, but also the details of the auction it belongs to. Even if those auction details don’t change, they’re still copied into every row.\nThis approach is useful for analysis, but it can also lead to large files and repeated information. In more advanced systems, like databases, we might store the auction information just once and link each bid to it. But flat files keep everything together in one place, which makes them easy to share and work with.\nLater in this chapter, we’ll see how other formats (like JSON and SQL) handle this differently—and how that affects the way we store and analyze data.\n\n💡 Tip: Use flat files for medium-sized, flat data when simplicity trumps scale",

    "section": "7.4 JSON Files: When one row might not be enough",
    "text": "7.4 JSON Files: When one row might not be enough\nFlat files are great when every observation fits neatly into one row. But what if each item in your dataset comes with its own mini-dataset inside—like multiple bids per auction?\nTrying to represent that in a flat file leads to a lot of repetition. Every bid needs to repeat the same auction information—item title, seller name, category—even if it doesn’t change. This design follows the tidy data principle, where each row is a single observation and each column is a variable. It’s ideal for analysis, but not always the most efficient way to store structured or repeated data.\nTo better handle these cases, we can use nested data formats—and one of the most popular is JSON.\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format designed to store structured data. It’s especially useful when one record contains multiple layers of information—for example, an auction that has several bids attached to it.\nWhy JSON?\n\nCaptures nested structures, such as multiple bids grouped within a single auction\nCommon in APIs, log files, and web applications\nMore compact and organized for data with repeating elements\n\nUnlike flat files, JSON allows us to store all related data in one object, without repeating fields. It’s human-readable, flexible, and widely used in real-world business data systems.\nJSON (short for JavaScript Object Notation) stores data as a set of key-value pairs. Think of it like a list of labeled boxes—each label is the name of a variable, and inside each box is the value.\nIn the context of our auction dataset, one auction might look like this in JSON format:\n{\n  \"item_id\": \"a001\",\n  \"title\": \"Vintage Coffee Table\",\n  \"category\": \"Furniture\",\n  \"seller\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"seller42\",\n    \"rating\": 4.8\n  },\n  \"bids\": [\n    { \"bidder_id\": \"user123\", \"amount\": 120, \"time\": \"2023-01-01 10:05\" },\n    { \"bidder_id\": \"user456\", \"amount\": 130, \"time\": \"2023-01-01 11:20\" }\n  ]\n}\nLet’s break it down:\n\nThe top-level keys (item_id, title, category) describe the auction itself.\nThe seller key contains a nested object with seller details.\nThe bids key holds a list of bid objects, each with its own bidder, amount, and time.\n\nThis structure keeps all related information grouped together—no need to repeat the title or seller info for every bid like we did in the CSV file. That’s (one of) the power(s) of JSON: it stores complex relationships without flattening the data.\nADD callout: JSON does not have to be nested!\n\n7.4.1 Working with Nested JSON Auction Data in R\nIn this section, we’ll learn how to work with nested JSON data in R using a simulated dataset of eBay-style auctions. Each auction record includes top-level information (like item title and category), seller information, and a nested list of bids placed by users. This structure is very common in the real world—especially when dealing with data from APIs or web applications.\nOur goal is to explore how to load and manipulate this nested structure using tidyverse tools. We’ll move step by step, from raw JSON to a tidy tibble.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Step 1: Load the JSON File\nWe’ll start by reading in the data using the read_json() function from the jsonlite package. This preserves the nested list structure exactly as it appears in the JSON file.\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nauctions_nested &lt;- read_json(\"_extras/code/data_storage/output/ebay_auctions_large.json\")\nThe object auctions_nested is a list of auction records. Each element in the list is a nested list with keys like item_id, title, seller, and bids.\n\n\n7.4.3 Step 2: Peek Inside a Single Record\nLet’s take a closer look at the structure of the first auction.\nstr(auctions_nested[[1]])\nTry also inspecting individual components:\nauctions_nested[[1]]$item_id\nauctions_nested[[1]]$seller$user_id\nauctions_nested[[1]]$bids[[1]]$amount\nThis is a good way to understand the JSON hierarchy before jumping into manipulation.\n\n\n7.4.4 Step 3: Wrap the List into a Tibble\nTo start working with this in tidyverse pipelines, we’ll wrap the list of auctions into a tibble with one column:\nauctions_tbl &lt;- tibble(record = auctions_nested)\nEach row of auctions_tbl now contains one full auction record.\n\n\n7.4.5 Step 4: Unnest the Top-Level Fields\nWe can begin flattening the nested structure one layer at a time using unnest_wider():\nauctions_tbl &lt;- auctions_tbl %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(record)\nNow we have columns like item_id, title, category, seller, and bids. Both seller and bids are still lists.\nWe can go further:\nauctions_tbl &lt;- auctions_tbl %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(seller, names_sep = \"_\")\nNow seller information like user_id and rating is available as separate columns.\n\n\n7.4.6 Step 5: Flattening the Bid Lists (Wide Format)\nWhat about the bids column? Each auction has its own list of bids, and each bid is a small list too. First, we can break it out into wide format:\nauctions_tbl_wide &lt;- auctions_tbl %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(bids, names_sep = \"_\")\nThis gives us one column for each bid: bids_1, bids_2, etc.—but these are still lists. We can unnest them as well:\nauctions_tbl_wide &lt;- auctions_tbl_wide %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(bids_1, names_sep = \"_\", names_repair = \"unique\") %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(bids_2, names_sep = \"_\", names_repair = \"unique\")\nThis gets tedious if there are many bids. So let’s automate it.\n\n\n7.4.7 Step 6: Automate the Unnesting of All Bid Columns\nUse this if you don’t know how many bids there will be ahead of time:\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nbid_cols &lt;- auctions_tbl_wide %&gt;%\n  select(starts_with(\"bids_\")) %&gt;%\n  select(where(is.list)) %&gt;%\n  names()\n\nauctions_tbl_wide &lt;- reduce(\n  bid_cols,\n  .init = auctions_tbl_wide,\n  .f = function(df, col) {\n    unnest_wider(df, !!sym(col), names_sep = \"_\", names_repair = \"unique\")\n  }\n)\n\n\n7.4.8 Step 7: Unnesting to Long Format\nInstead of going wider, we can go longer. This means one row per bid:\nbids_long &lt;- auctions_tbl %&gt;%\n  unnest_longer(bids) %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(bids)\nNow we have a tidy table where each row is a bid, including the item ID and other metadata. This is often easier to work with for analysis and looks very much like the CSV format!.\n\n\n7.4.9 Bonus: Nesting Back Again\nLet’s reverse the process and group the bids back into a nested column:\nbids_renested &lt;- bids_long %&gt;%\n  select(item_id, bidder_id, amount, time) %&gt;%\n  group_by(item_id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(bids = list(cur_data()), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n💡 Extension: Compare unnest_wider() vs unnest_longer() strategies\n\n\n💬 JSON teaches data structure thinking — objects, lists, hierarchies",

Management wants to: - Better understand different types of customers - Identify which customers are most likely to respond to marketing offers\nAvailable Data: (based on Chapman & Feit, 2019) - Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase - Frequency: How often the customer purchases - Monetary Value: How much money the customer spends - Response: Whether the customer responded to a previous marketing offer (yes/no)\nThese three features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) together form what is called an RFM Framework in marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?\n\n\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV) estimates how much revenue a customer will bring over their relationship with a company. Customers with high RFM scores are often the most valuable.\n\n\nRFM Framework: - Recency: Customers who purchased recently are more likely to buy again. - Frequency: Customers who purchase often are more engaged. - Monetary: Customers who spend more are usually more valuable.\nUnderstanding RFM helps businesses estimate a customer’s future value (CLV).\nThis gives us an opportunity to describe customer behavior, cluster customers, and summarize patterns of campaign success!",

Choose the number of clusters (K). 2. Randomly assign customers to clusters. 3. Calculate the “center” (mean) of each cluster. 4. Reassign customers to the nearest center. 5. Repeat until cluster assignments stop changing.\nHands-on Walkthrough: - Start by plotting recency and monetary value. - Question: What do you notice about where the points are concentrated? - Apply K-means with different values of K (e.g., K=2, K=3). - Question: Does one cluster seem bigger or smaller than the others? - Interpret what each cluster might represent (e.g., “Frequent Big Spenders”, “Infrequent Bargain Shoppers”).\nSimple Analogy: Imagine you’re sorting socks by color without labels. You group similar colors together by looking at them, not by reading tags.\nBusiness Use: - Design different marketing strategies for each cluster. - Identify groups based on RFM behavior linked to potential CLV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMini Visual: Before K-means: random points → After K-means: color-coded clusters.\n\n\n\nReminder: Clustering is descriptive.

    "text": "10.5 Limitations of Descriptive Analytics\nWhile descriptive analytics is powerful for organizing and summarizing information, it has important limitations to keep in mind:\n\nDescribing is not explaining: Patterns we observe (e.g., frequent buyers respond more) do not prove one thing causes another.\nHidden patterns: Sometimes, averages can hide differences between groups. (This is known as Simpson’s paradox.)\nOver-simplification: Summaries and clusters simplify complex behaviors but may miss important details.\n\n\n10.5.1 Simulation: Simpson’s Paradox in Marketing Campaigns\nImagine you run two marketing campaigns targeting customers based on purchase frequency:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Group\nCampaign A Response Rate\nCampaign B Response Rate\nNumber of Customers\n\n\n\n\nFrequent Buyers\n80%\n70%\n50\n\n\nInfrequent Buyers\n30%\n20%\n200\n\n\n\n\nAmong frequent buyers, Campaign A performs better.\nAmong infrequent buyers, Campaign A also performs better.\n\nSuppose Campaign B heavily targeted frequent buyers:\n\n\n\nCustomer Group\nCampaign A Customers\nCampaign B Customers\n\n\n\n\nFrequent Buyers\n50\n150\n\n\nInfrequent Buyers\n200\n50\n\n\n\nIn that case, Campaign B might appear better overall, even if it was worse within every segment!\n\nLesson: Descriptive summaries (like overall response rates) can be misleading if we don’t account for differences between customer groups.

    "text": "The Topic: Understanding Melbourne’s Housing Market\nMelbourne’s real estate market is one of the most dynamic in Australia. Property prices are influenced by several factors, including location, dwelling type, and proximity to the Central Business District (CBD). Buyers, sellers, and policymakers constantly analyze housing trends to make informed decisions. Understanding these trends is crucial in a $2 trillion+ housing market, where even small fluctuations in pricing expectations can have significant financial impacts.\nA key question we will explore is: How do property prices vary by region, dwelling type, and location? By analyzing real estate data, we can identify patterns that help explain the drivers of Melbourne’s housing prices and their implications for different stakeholders in the market.\n\n\nThe Data: The Melbourne Housing Market Dataset\nWe will use a dataset containing real estate sales data from Melbourne. The dataset provides insights into housing trends and includes key variables that influence property prices.\nThe dataset captures the property location within broader metropolitan regions (regionname), allowing us to compare trends across different areas. It also includes the type of dwelling, classified as House (h), Townhouse (t), or Apartment (u), enabling us to assess price differences based on housing type. The sale price (price) provides a measure of market value, while the distance to the CBD (distance) helps analyze the impact of proximity to the city center on property prices.\nSimilar datasets are widely used by real estate analysts, banks, and property investors to assess housing trends, predict future movements, and guide investment decisions. Through this tutorial, we’ll work with real-world data to uncover patterns and develop a deeper understanding of Melbourne’s property market. Let’s dive in!\n\n\nWhere we’re headed\nJust a few lines of R code transform numbers to data visualizations.\nFrom this:\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 6\n   type      address          postcode   price distance regionname    \n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         \n 1 House     85 Turner St         3067 1480000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 2 House     25 Bloomburg St      3067 1035000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 3 House     5 Charles St         3067 1465000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 4 House     40 Federation La     3067  850000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 5 House     55a Park St          3067 1600000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 6 House     129 Charles St       3067  941000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 7 House     124 Yarra St         3067 1876000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 8 House     98 Charles St        3067 1636000      2.5 Northern Metro\n 9 House     217 Langridge St     3067 1000000      2.5 Northern Metro\n10 Townhouse 18a Mollison St      3067  745000      2.5 Northern Metro\n\n\nto this (REMARK Still need to complete the pretty-ing of plots)",

    "text": "Prepare these Exercises before Class\nPrepare these exercises before coming to class. Plan to spend 90 minutes on these exercises.\n\nExercise 1: Plotting Number of Listings by Region\nBy the end of this exercise, your plot should look similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a). If you were a real estate investor or city planner, why would knowing the number of listings by region be valuable? What decisions could be influenced by this visualization?\n(b). Use the starter code below to create a first version of the bar plot. Replace YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME with the appropriate variable name from the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Bar Plot?\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar plot is a graphical representation of categorical data, where each category is represented by a bar whose height reflects its frequency or proportion. It is commonly used to compare counts across different groups, making it easy to identify the most and least common categories in a dataset. In business and research, bar plots help visualize trends, distributions, and key differences in data at a glance.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_bar()\n\n(c). Extend the plot above by adding labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and title. Use the labs() function to add these labels. The code below also rotates the axis labels by 25 degrees to improve readability.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, hjust = 1),\n    )\n\n(d). Change the color of the bars using the fill argument in geom_bar(). You can use any color you like, see (here)[https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-color.html] for a list of colors you can choose from.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_bar(fill = \"YOUR_COLOR\") +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, hjust = 1),\n    )\n\n(e). What patterns do you notice in the number of listings? Are certain regions overrepresented or underrepresented? How might this affect housing supply and pricing?\n(f). What could be improved in the visualization? Consider aspects like color, ordering of bars, labels, or additional annotations.\n\n\nExercise 2: Visualizing the distribution of Prices by Dwelling Type\nBy the end of this exercise, your plot should look similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a). Why is a histogram useful for understanding price distributions? What insights can we gain from plotting price distributions separately for each dwelling type?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Histogram?\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram is a visualization that represents the distribution of numerical data by dividing values into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. Unlike a bar plot, which displays categorical data, a histogram is used for continuous variables like price, age, or distance.\nHistograms help identify patterns in data, such as skewness, outliers, and central tendencies, making them a crucial tool for understanding how values are distributed in a dataset.\n\n\n\n(b). Use the starter code below to create a basic histogram of house prices. Replace YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME with the correct variable.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50)\n\n(c). Extend the plot above by adding labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and title using the labs() function.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50) +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\")\n\n(d). Modify the x-axis so that prices are displayed in dollar format by adding scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar). We have rotated the axis labels to make the numbers easier to read.\n\nhousing %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = price)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50) +\n    YOUR_CODE_HERE +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1),\n    )\n\n(e). Add fill = type inside aes() to color the histogram by dwelling type and then create subplots by dwelling type.\n\nhousing %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = price, YOUR_CODE_HERE)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 50) +\n    YOUR_CODE_HERE +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_X_AXIS_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_Y_AXIS_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1),\n    ) +\n    YOUR_CODE_HERE\n\n(f). What does the histogram tell you about price differences between dwelling types?\n(g). What additional improvements or customizations could enhance this visualization? How might these changes improve clarity, interpretability, or storytelling in the data?\n\n\nExercise 3: The Price - Distance Relationship\nBy the end of this exercise, your plot should look similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a). Why might we expect a relationship between price and distance to the CBD?\n(b). Use the starter code below to build a scatter plot of price vs. distance, replacing YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME with the correct column names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Scatter Plot?\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables by plotting individual data points. Each dot represents one observation, helping identify patterns, clusters, and trends. In this case, it allows us to explore how house prices change with distance.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n(c). Since we have a large number of data points, many overlap, making it difficult to distinguish individual observations. Modify the geom_point() function to reduce over-plotting by adjusting the alpha value. Experiment with different values (e.g., 0.1, 0.05, 0.01) and describe how each affects the visualization.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = YOUR_NUMBER)\n\n(d). We can better understand the relationship by adding a statistical transformation to the plot. Complete the geom_smooth() function call to overlay a straight line over the data. The se = FALSE argument removes the confidence interval around the line.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = YOUR_NUMBER) +\n    geom_smooth(method = YOUR_METHOD, formula = YOUR_FORMULA, se = FALSE)\n\n(e). Finally, add labels to the x-axis, y-axis, and title using the labs() function. You can also customize the color of the points and the line using the color argument.\n\nggplot(housing, aes(x = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME, y = YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = YOUR_NUMBER, color = \"YOUR_COLOR\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = YOUR_METHOD, formula = YOUR_FORMULA, color = \"YOUR_COLOR\", se = FALSE)\n    scale_y_continuous(YOUR_CODE) +\n    labs(x = \"YOUR_LABEL\", y = \"YOUR_LABEL\", title = \"YOUR_TITLE\")\n\n(f). What does the scatter plot reveal about the relationship between house prices and distance to the CBD? How does the line help interpret this relationship?",

Implement the changes suggested in the R code below.\n\nhousing %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = price, YOUR_CODE_HERE)) +\n    # This line adds proportions by facet -- explain intuitively, not technically\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count) / tapply(after_stat(count), after_stat(PANEL), sum)[after_stat(PANEL)]),\n                   bins = 50) +\n    scale_x_continuous(\n        YOUR_CODE_HERE\n    ) +\n    scale_y_continuous(YOUR_CODE_HERE) +\n    labs(x = \"Price\", y = \"YOUR_LABEL\", title = \"Prices by Dwelling Type\") + \n    facet_wrap(~type) +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n    scale_fill_okabe_ito() +\n    theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  # Center title\n    )\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nprice_hist &lt;-\n    housing %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = price, fill = type)) +\n    # ggplot(aes(x=price, group = type, fill = type)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count) / tapply(after_stat(count), after_stat(PANEL), sum)[after_stat(PANEL)]),\n                   bins = 50) +\n    # Natural log scale for x-axis with meaningful breaks\n    scale_x_continuous(\n        trans = \"log\",\n        labels = scales::dollar,\n        breaks = c(150e3, 500e3, 1e6, 2.5e6, 6e6)#,\n        #labels = scales::comma\n    ) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n    labs(x = \"Price\", y = \"Proportion within Type\", title = \"Prices by Dwelling Type\") + \n    facet_wrap(~type) +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n    scale_fill_okabe_ito() +\n    theme_classic() + \n    theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  # Center title\n    )\n\n\n \n\n\nExercise 6: Improving the Price-Distance Relationship Plot\n(a). Together with your peers, propose three changes you want to make to the plot in Exercise 3. Discuss the rationale behind each change and how it might improve the visualization.\n(b). Work with your tutor to create an agreed upon list of changes to make to the plot. What steps do you need to take to make these improvements?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Note\n\n\n\nUse this exercise to guide students to the following changes:\n\nCentered title\nDecide to focus on one dwelling type\nColor points to match the House type chosen\nColor blind sensitive palette\nNon-linear model fit\n\n\n\n(c). Implement the changes suggested in the R code below.\n\nhousing %&gt;%\n    filter(type == \"House\") %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = price)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.05, , color = palette_okabe_ito()[2]) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,2), se = FALSE, color = palette_okabe_ito()[6], linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n    labs(x = \"Distance to CBD (km)\", y = \"Price\", title = \"House Price vs. Distance\") +\n    theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  # Center title\n    ) \n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nprice_dist &lt;- \n    housing %&gt;%\n    filter(type == \"House\") %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = price)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.05, , color = palette_okabe_ito()[2]) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,2), se = FALSE, color = palette_okabe_ito()[6], linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n    labs(x = \"Distance to CBD\", y = \"Price\", title = \"House Price vs. Distance\") +\n    scale_color_okabe_ito() +\n    theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  # Center title\n    )  \n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Putting the plots together\n(a). Use the code below to combine the plots for the three exercises above. Replace PLOT_ONE, PLOT_TWO, and PLOT_THREE with the plots you created in Exercises 5, 6, and 7.\n\nPLOT_ONE /    \n    (PLOT_TWO | PLOT_THREE) + \n    plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") & \n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n(b). Save this combined plot as a PDF file using the ggsave() function. You can specify the file name and dimensions using the filename and width and height arguments.\n\nggsave(\"YOUR_FILE_NAME\", width = 12, height = 8)\n\n\n\nExercise 8: Synthesizing the Findings\nIf you were presenting these results in a business meeting, how would you explain the key takeaways? Structure your summary to include:\n\nWhat you analyzed (data, variables)\nWhat you found (key insights from the visualizations)\nWhat decisions could be made based on this information?",
